Antiquities trafficking has been a source of funding, akin to drug and weapons trafficking, for everything from ISIS and other terrorist groups to the Italian mafia and Latin American drug cartels. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)The EU law, which was first passed in 2019, requires strict licensing and registry for the import of art, books, artifacts and other cultural goods older than 250 years which originated outside of the Union.

Those in the art world who felt the law would place a significant burden on dealers, heavily lobbied against it, the Art Newspaper reported. They argued that the requirements, especially the requirement to identify the source country couldn't fully be applied to artifacts with complex histories. They also argued that antique books, art and artifacts, are significantly different realms and can't reasonably be regulated under the same law.

""As much as 20% of printing in 15th-century Venice was done for England. The books were printed in Italy, then maybe bound in France, illuminated in Belgium then sold to England -- what's the so-called 'source country' then?"" Sibylle Wieduwilt, an antique book dealer in Germany, told the Art Newspaper before the law was ratified.

She added that archaeological artefacts and books are ""two completely different things and should not be treated in the same way.""

However, it was an attempt by the EU to clamp down on the trade which has ballooned to a multi-billion dollar industry and has been known to be a source of funding, akin to drug and weapons trafficking, for everything from ISIS and other terrorist groups to the Italian mafia and Latin American drug cartels.

According to the law, it was designed to ensure ""the preservation of humanity's cultural heritage and the prevention of terrorist financing and money laundering through the sale of pillaged cultural goods to buyers in the Union.""

The looting of cultural property from active war zones is considered a war crime under the 1954 Hague Convention.

However, Daniel Dalton, a former member of the European Parliament from the U.K. told Art Newspaper last month that once Brexit is finalized, the country would not be continuing to uphold the law.

While a license is still required for the export of the U.K.'s own cultural goods, under the U.K.'s new laws, no such barrier exists for the import of those from other countries.

However, the EU law will still apply to those who want to show off their goods or collections at international exhibitions within the Union.",6388907106,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13629-after-brexit-the-uk-is-open-to-almost-unrestrained-antiquities-trade,,,

3,:Article,news,Regulating the Art Market Is Good Foreign Policy,278039100,2021-01-14T14:34:00Z,-0.019607843,"On January 1, the U.S. Congress passed its annual defense bill over the veto of President Donald Trump. The $741 billion National Defense Authorization Act funded the Pentagon, greenlighted pay raises for U.S. troops, and allocated resources to counter China and bolster cybersecurity. Tucked alongside these provisions was one that addressed a lower-profile concern: illicit activity in the antiquities trade.

The $28.3 billion U.S. art market has long evaded regulation. A culture of secrecy, together with rules that allow buyers and sellers to remain anonymous, has allowed criminals to exploit the art market to launder money, evade taxes, and finance terrorism. In July 2020, for example, a Senate report revealed that Russian oligarchs had skirted U.S. sanctions in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea by buying more than $18 million in art through shell companies and an intermediary. When the major auction houses ran their due diligence, they investigated the intermediary but never asked whom he was buying for.

For the better part of the past century, the federal government capitulated to the wishes of a powerful coalition of museums and art collectors who lobbied against efforts to regulate the industry. But over the past two decades, in response to high-profile accounts of looting in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the discovery that the Islamic State (or ISIS) was using the sale of stolen antiquities to bankroll its operations, lawmakers have started to see an unfettered art market as a threat to national security, and they have acted accordingly.

The new law brings some welcome accountability to this realm: it subjects the trade in ancient artifacts to the transparency requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, a 1970 law that requires designated entities to help federal authorities detect and prevent financial crimes. Antiquities dealers fought the measure, but it passed with wide bipartisan support.

The defense bill marks a real advance in the decades-long evolution of Washington's approach to the art market. But its transparency requirements are only a first step. Congress and the State Department need to make it easier for the United States to assist countries whose patrimony is at risk -- and not only when national security is clearly implicated. Protecting cultural property cuts off a major source of funding for terrorists and other transnational criminal organizations, but it is also smart diplomacy, a way to signal respect for a country's heritage and build lasting goodwill. For a new administration looking to repair relationships around the globe, cultural protections are a win-win.

Since at least 1970, when the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted a landmark convention to protect cultural property, the United States has been reluctant to combat antiquities theft. The convention asked states to stop importing stolen cultural property and to help return looted items to their countries of origin. Although the United States participated in drafting the treaty -- exerting its influence primarily to water down the text -- it was not among the first group of countries to sign on. When the Senate eventually gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the convention in 1972, it added a reservation requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation before the treaty could take effect domestically.

Congress tried and failed to pass such legislation for the next decade. The State Department argued that the United States should help countries protect their cultural property ""on grounds of principle, good foreign relations, and concern for the preservation of the cultural heritage of mankind."" But that plea was no match for art dealers and their congressional allies, who maintained that regulating the art market would put the country at a competitive disadvantage relative to art-importing nations that had not yet signed the treaty. Coin collectors, who worried about aggressive customs enforcement, formed another vigorous lobby against the bill.

For a new administration looking to repair relationships around the globe, cultural protections are a win-win.

The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act finally passed Congress in 1983, implementing the UNESCO treaty into U.S. law. It provided a long-sought framework for the United States to help countries protect their cultural heritage, allowing the president to sign bilateral agreements with requesting states to restrict imports of looted antiquities. But the law did not make it easy for states to ask for help. States wishing to secure U.S. assistance had to submit formal requests in writing, documenting their own efforts to protect their patrimony. Bilateral agreements then had to go through a lengthy bureaucratic approval process, and no agreement could last longer than five years without being extended.

Put simply, although the law was an important step forward, tackling the theft of stolen antiquities remained an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy. For policymakers, the issue lacked urgency -- it took another 12 years for Washington to negotiate its first bilateral agreement (with El Salvador, in 1995), and even now, the United States has fewer than two dozen such agreements in force.

Events in the early 2000s began drawing public attention to the issue of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban shocked the world by destroying the Bamiyan Buddhas, sixth-century statues carved out of sandstone cliffs in central Afghanistan. But what really galvanized Congress was the looting of the National Museum of Iraq in 2003. More than 15,000 artifacts were stolen from the museum during the mass looting that accompanied the arrival of American troops in Baghdad. Although a U.S. Army unit tried to investigate a report of looting at the museum, retreating under heavy fire, the media blamed American troops for standing by. Under pressure to act, Congress authorized the president to impose import restrictions on Iraqi antiquities without having to wait for a formal request from the Iraqi government.

More than a decade later, stolen antiquities would resurface as a U.S. national security issue with regard to ISIS. In 2015, U.S. Special Forces raided the compound of ISIS leader Abu Sayyaf, near Deir ez-Zor, Syria, and found receipts indicating that the group had made more than $1.25 million from looting and selling antiquities. In fact, ISIS ran a department of antiquities through which it sold permits to looters wishing to raid archaeological sites and then took a cut of any sale. To lawmakers, the national security implications of protecting cultural property had become clear. In 2016, by unanimous consent, the Senate passed the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act, directing the president to impose import restrictions on cultural property from Syria.

Over the years that followed, lawmakers worked to close loopholes that make the art market attractive to money launderers. Art dealers dispute the prevalence of illicit deals in their market, but the Treasury Department considers the buying and selling of art to be a ""well understood method of illicit financial transactions."" In December 2019, for example, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a Beirut diamond dealer with close connections to Hezbollah who had been using an art gallery and extensive private art collection to shelter and launder money. The July 2020 Senate report, which detailed how Russian oligarchs had taken advantage of the U.S. art market, confirmed the industry's vulnerability. Congress could no longer afford not to act.

The new rules specifically extend the Bank Secrecy Act to those ""engaged in the trade of antiquities,"" but their application affords the United States an opportunity to regulate the art market more broadly. The European Union and the United Kingdom already subject high-value art transactions to regulations against money laundering, and there is no reason the United States -- which accounts for 44 percent of the global art market -- shouldn't do the same.

Likewise, the United States should seize the occasion to bulk up its protection of cultural property. Congress could amend the 1983 act to include a blanket ban on importing stolen cultural patrimony; it could model this law on ones already on the books in the European Union. Doing so would build goodwill with countries whose patrimony is at risk -- they would no longer have to request U.S. assistance to receive it -- and send a clear signal to illicit buyers and sellers.

The United States should seize the occasion to bulk up its protection of cultural property.

Even short of a blanket ban, Congress and the State Department could help clear the roadblocks that prevent states from asking for help. The State Department should encourage diplomats to publicize and advocate for bilateral agreements in high-risk countries, and Congress might consider loosening some of the application requirements -- especially for countries that lack the detailed records to prove that they have taken reasonable steps to protect their cultural property on their own. To streamline the process, the advisory committee that processes the applications, which currently meets three times a year, could meet more frequently.

Laws protecting cultural property will ultimately be only as good as their enforcement, and a dedicated effort is needed in this area, as well. The Manhattan district attorney's office furnishes one promising model: its Antiquities Trafficking Unit has seized more than $175 million worth of antiquities since 2012. At the federal level, the Department of Justice could establish an office for investigating cultural property crimes, including money laundering, antiquities trafficking, and fraud. The most successful prosecutions will have to be global in nature, involving coordinated investigations across multiple countries, and they will need to be sensitive to new developments, such as the proliferation of online sales platforms and social networks, that allow the black market to flourish.

A broad effort to clean up the art market may make it costlier to do business in the art world in the short term. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Tighter regulation will make the art market less vulnerable to those who would exploit it for criminal purposes. And by strengthening cultural property protections, the new administration can not only weaken terrorists and other criminal organizations but also contribute to rebuilding U.S. friendships abroad.",6388520691,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-01-14/regulating-art-market-good-foreign-policy,,,

The regained finds were apparently looted from graves and sites all around the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Africa and even South America.

The stolen artifacts were hidden in storage rooms in private homes. There were coins from the Seleucid Empire, stone statuettes, red-and-black pottery from Greece and Italy, Roman-era oil lamps, jewelry, Egyptian sarcophagus lids and painted wooden boxes, and a striking green glass vessel decorated with faces among them.

Many of the local artifacts were coins from the Seleucid Empire, which ruled what is modern-day Israel from 312 B.C. to 63 B.C.. There were also stone statuettes, red-and-black pottery from Greece and Italy, Roman-era oil lamps, jewelry, Egyptian sarcophagus lids and painted wooden boxes, and a striking green glass vessel decorated with faces.

The focus of the theft prevention unit is items made before A.D. 1700, he said.

Much of the pottery found had actually been cleaned and pieced together. It's not clear whether the original looters who took the artifacts from burial sites restored the pottery or whether underground restorers did the work. Three suspects were arrested, according to Haaretz, with more arrests expected. However, the suspects were dealers, not the original thieves.

A lawyer explains,420691053,2021-01-06T16:10:00Z,0.02745098,"Congress is increasing its regulation of antiquities trade and while its powers are limited for now, change will come so the art industry must prepare The new regulations will bring greater scrutiny of dealers in antiquities in the US Photo by Stijn te Strake

On 1 January, the US Senate overrode President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 (NDAA), a bill that (perhaps surprisingly) included rules affecting the art market. Specifically, the new law subjects antiquities dealers to the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, requires registration of the ultimate beneficial ownership of limited liability companies, and directs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the Department of the Treasury to conduct a study of money laundering in the art market. Long considered but only now passed, the bill is a significant step into regulating the US art and antiquities market, though still far less invasive than the European Union's current approach. The new regulations raise questions about the cost benefit balance of compliance, but leave no doubt after last year's Senate report that regulators have the art market in their sights and the market must respond if it wants to have a say in the oversight that is sure to come.

Whatever one thinks of the regulations or the regulators, these things are happening. And while it is questionable whether FinCEN is the right body to conduct a study of the art market, the market has a choice here. We can complain, or we can get involved in the dialogue. I would rather be at the table in the discussion than outside the room. The FinCEN study may not be ideal, but it is an opportunity that responsible actors will ignore at their peril.

The new law

The law amends the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 5312(a) to extend to ""dealers in antiquities."" That phrase is not defined, and thus begs the question of who a dealer in antiquities is (and who is not). It does include ""advisors"" to such persons, so it is more expansive than it may first appear. These antiquities dealers are to file what are called ""suspicious activity"" reports, to ensure that potential clients are not among those being sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), and to report any cash transactions over $10,000.

The law also takes aim at another tool often used to thwart transparency: limited liability companies (LLCs). The role of LLCs is often in the eye of the beholder. Like any capital structure, LLCs are overwhelmingly used for legitimate purposes. Corporations and individuals form LLCs to hold assets, to run discrete lines of business, and to separate unrelated activities. In the United States LLCs are creatures of state law and must be formed in compliance with the rules of the respective Secretaries of State. The person who charters the company is publicly visible but is usually an agent of the company (like a law firm). Who the actual shareholders are is not usually public knowledge. Indeed that is often the point.

there is no question that if you are out to obfuscate, multiple layers of capital structures are an effective way to do so.

This is all perfectly ordinary, and one way I often attach red flags to analysis is the use of ""shell company"" as a pejorative per se. But in fairness, there is no question that if you are out to obfuscate, multiple layers of capital structures are an effective way to do so.

The law will now require the filing of beneficial ownership information with FinCEN. That information would still not be publicly visible on demand, but it would be more easily accessed by law enforcement or other legal proceedings.

Most broadly, the law contains what amounts to handwriting on the wall about what comes next. The bill directs FinCEN to ""perform a study of the facilitation of money laundering and the financing of terrorism through the trade in works of art."" To that end, FinCEN is required to submit a report within a year to Congress addressing, among other things, the extent of money laundering and terrorism financing in the art trade, the need for further regulation, and similar themes.

What comes next

This is where the rubber will hit the road, and there is reason for concern. Last summer's Senate report was rhetorically sweeping, but was actually about one case of two businessmen already on the OFAC sanctions list. The Senate investigators spoke in detail to multiple auction houses and still came away with mostly recycled clichés, but perhaps some degree of removal from specific investigative targets will illustrate the point better. Can we expect better of FinCEN? Not unless those actually involved in the trade speak up. There are too many readily-accessible story lines for regulators to resist, whether it's the same rehashed article about freeports or, as above, complaining about ""shell companies."" And speaking up can have an effect, witness the recent pushback on UNESCO's use of unsourced numbers about the market value of illicit artifacts trade.

The feeling here is that the effect on transparency of the Bank Secrecy extension will be smaller than the cost because the UBO information will be no more knowable to counterparties than it was before. The best approach remains vigilance to a variety of information, including UBO but also the history and risk factors of the object and the counterparty. Accusing the art market of being rife with crime and money laundering is a familiar trope, but the perception is relevant and has clearly influenced policy that will affect the day to day. Whatever an ""antiquities dealer"" is, most are not major auction houses and the sustainability of compliance services or personnel in a year that has crushed the small and medium sized businesses could be severe.

As noted, however, the key point is that the issue is on the policymakers' radar, and across the political spectrum. Change is coming. The question is: what will it be?

21,:Article,news,Lawmakers Are Cracking Down on the 'Unregulated' US Art Market. Here's How a New Anti-Money Laundering Law Will Affect Dealers,119216317,2021-01-06T13:32:00Z,0.11372549,"The new regulations target antiquities dealers, but could soon apply across the art market.

The US antiquities trade is going to face far stricter oversight in 2021 than it has in the past.

On January 1, the Senate overrode President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021, a bill that includes a new law requiring antiquities dealers to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. That means dealers will now have to adopt anti-money laundering programs designed to root out illegal practices.

One of those requirements involves identifying and registering the so-called ""ultimate beneficial owner"" -- or the true owner of a limited liability company. Now, savvy collectors and investors who rely on offshore entities and shell companies to conceal their true identities when executing art trades, particularly high-value ones, will have a harder time doing so.

The US treasury department is expected to draft regulations on the specific policies that antiquities dealers must implement. Congress has already given the department guidance on which topics to address, including suggesting that the regulations vary by the size of the business, the size of the transaction, the location of the transaction -- and whether the dealer must identify the purchaser when he or she is working through an agent or intermediary.

The new regulations could also extend beyond the antiquities market. This year, the treasury department is expected to complete a study on whether there is evidence of money laundering in the broader art market. The Senate banking committee will then use the findings to determine whether the same anti-money laundering provisions applied to antiquities dealers should apply to all art dealers.

According to one art law attorney, the outcome of that study is ""a foregone conclusion: an alliance of government regulators, class-conscious legislators, and art market critics will seize upon the opportunity to convince the Biden cabinet to regulate the art business,"" says Michael McCullough of the New York firm Pearlstein and McCullough.

Observers in the auction and gallery art markets have been closely following the bill, which comes on the heels of related legal measures taken in the UK.

A representative for Christie's said the auction house ""welcomes the opportunity to work with US regulators on appropriate and enforceable anti-money laundering guidelines.""

The Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), meanwhile, has been in talks with congressional committees about the bill with the hopes of balancing the burden on those in the trade.

""The ADAA has sought to ensure that any new regulation is adequately supported by data about the scale and scope of any identified problems,"" the organization said in a statement. Its legal and public policy advisors have been working with lawmakers to ""generally introduce them to, and educate them about, the vibrant small businesses that make up the community of art dealers in the United States.""

The most difficult aspect of creating workable anti-money laundering policy, McCullough says, ""is finding the right balance between complying with law and continuing to honor a client's need for discretion and privacy.""

Anti-money laundering programs typically cost thousands of dollars per year to implement, as well as significant time and effort, according to Washington, DC-based attorney Peter Tompa, who represents organizations that lobby for museums and dealers. ""The costs to small and micro business are substantial,"" he says. ""Furthermore, it is impossible to 'fly under the radar screen' of such requirements; such regulations are enforced by the banks which will close accounts that do not comply.""

Many in the industry say they've been expecting stricter legal scrutiny for a while. Last year, a subcommittee in the US Senate issued a strongly worded report on the international art market, calling it the ""largest legal unregulated market in the United States."" That analysis left ""no doubt,"" according to attorney Nicholas O'Donnell, ""that regulators have the art market in their sights and the market must respond if it wants to have a say in the oversight that is sure to come.""",6376012595,https://news.artnet.com/art-world/what-will-stricter-us-oversight-of-the-antiquities-trade-look-like-1935081,,,

23,:Article,news,Israeli Authorities Take Down Gang Engaged in the Illegal Antiquities Trade,421148719,2021-01-05T15:55:00Z,-0.082352941,"The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), the Israel Police and the Tax Authority launched a joint operation in the Tel Aviv area and captured a criminal network that was engaged in the illegal antiquities trade.

Thousands of ancient, spectacular and rare items, hundreds and thousands of years old, from both Israel and around the world, were seized on Monday in a major operation; items that were allegedly robbed from cemeteries throughout the Mediterranean basin, as well as from Africa and South America.

The IAA, Police and the Tax Authority have been tracking a number of suspects in Israel in recent months.

Evidence was gathered against the suspects, who were arrested when the authorities raided three centers in the Gush Dan area. The suspects were detained for further questioning.

Amir Ganor, director of the IAA's Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery (UPAR), stated that ""this is one of the most significant operations carried out in Israel against illegal trade in antiquities.""

The IAA inspectors were amazed to discover thousands of items worthy of display in museums, including many rare finds dating from the 1st millennium BCE through the 11 century CE.

The artifacts included hundreds of ancient coins, some of which are very rare, precious stones inlaid with jewelry, pieces of statues, figurines and heads of gods from the Roman period, dozens of rare painted pottery of the type ""black figures and red figures"" from the 5 century BCE, worship vessels, parts of statues and more.

Some of the items were looted from tombs, sealed in antiquity. The objects left in the tombs were left as offerings to the dead, and according to the belief, were to accompany the dead to the next world.

The IAA is tracking down the source of the items and is investigating whether they were robbed from an antiquities site in Israel or from the Mediterranean Basin.

The Interpol and other international enforcement bodies are also involved in the investigation.

""This is the beginning of the investigation,"" Ganor clarified.

""Antiquities are a heritage asset belonging to all cultures and humanity and cannot be treated as if they were vegetables or other consumer products that have a substitute,"" he added.

According to Ganor, ""an archeological find that is detached from its archaeological context by antiquities robbers and sold for the greed of money, in fact created a black hole in history, and we are working to prevent this in every way.""

Excavating in antiquities sites without a license and destroying such sites constitute severe violations of the law in Israel, for which the law prescribes up to five years in prison.",6374610598,https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/israeli-authorities-take-down-gang-engaged-in-the-illegal-antiquities-trade/2021/01/05/,,,

In countries where artifacts are looted, their illegal trade is often a significant funding source for both organized crime and militant groups. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)The more than 4,500 pages-long bill authorized a US$740 billion defense budget, but was packaged with several riders and amendments. President Donald Trump initially vetoed the bill, but his veto was overridden by a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and the House.

One division of the bill was devoted to anti-money laundering measures, including such efforts in the antiquities and arts trade.

As a cash-heavy industry with too often little oversight, both the legal and illegal antiquities markets have long been considered ripe for money laundering purposes.

While there are money laundering risks even in the trade of legitimately acquired artifacts, the art world has found itself embroiled in money laundering and organized crime through the trade and sale of looted cultural property bearing false provenance records.

For the buyers, false provenance records can boost the value of an item whose sale can then be used to underwrite illegal deals or whose donation can be used for a bloated tax write-off.

In countries where artifacts are looted, their illegal trade is often a significant funding source for both organized crime and militant groups.

""You cannot look at it separately from combating trafficking in drugs and weapons. We know that the same groups are engaged, because it generates big money,"" said Catherine de Bolle, Executive Director of Europol after a major crackdown on the trade back in May.

According to a 2018 report by Standards Charter Bank, the illegal antiquities trade is a multibillion dollar industry which ""not only robs us of our past and cultural heritage, but recent cases have evidenced that looting and trafficking of art and antiquities funds criminal activities and creates conflict and extremism around the world, producing long-lasting economic damage.""

The looting of cultural property from active war zones is also considered a war crime under the 1954 Hague convention.

Though the specific provisions will be decided on by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), according to The New York Times, the bill will broaden the 1970 bank secrecy act and require dealers to provide greater transparency in deals over a certain dollar amount.

That's something industry leaders fought strongly against, and in the last two years alone the auction house Christies spent over US$100,000 to influence the bill, according to the Times.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" Tess Davis, the executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, told the Times.",6374058399,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13577-new-us-bill-tackles-money-laundering-in-the-antiquities-trade,,,

One of the little-acknowledged features of the National Defense Authorization Act, finally passed over the president*'s veto at the end of last week, is the fact that, within that massive bill, Congress took serious action to sharpen the country's regulations regarding money laundering -- which, come to think of it, may have been yet another reason why the president* vetoed the thing. From ThomsonReuters:

The stated purpose of the AML Act includes improving coordination and information sharing among those U.S. agencies tasked with administering AML requirements, federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies, national security agencies, the intelligence community, and financial institutions. It also seeks to modernize the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. AML law, and other related laws to help the government and private sector better respond to new and emerging threats, and ensure efforts to combat financial crime are based more clearly on risk.

Additionally, it would require companies to report their beneficial ownership to the U.S. Treasury Department at the time of incorporation, providing law enforcement a registry to query during investigations, thereby raising the corporate veil that has traditionally allowed criminals to hide behind shell companies.

Another provision applies the anti-laundering statute to a marketplace that heretofore has been pretty much the Wild West -- namely, the worldwide trade in art and antiquities, which apparently has evolved into one of the busiest coin-ops in the world. From the New York Times:

Watchdogs have urged Congress to tighten regulations on the antiquities trade for years. The looting of cultural heritage sites in countries like Syria and Iraq has resulted in a growing black market for Middle Eastern antiquities. Law enforcement abroad has seized hundreds of artifacts, which officials believe trace back to earlier excavations carried out by terrorist groups like ISIS.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" said Tess Davis, the executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, a nonprofit organization that monitors the illicit trade of artifacts.

""A pawnshop's business model does not differ greatly from that of a Sotheby's or Christie's,"" she added. Yet pawnbrokers fall under the purview of Bank Secrecy Act, but auction houses do not. ""Why should the rules be stricter for a mom-and-pop business hawking stereos in Milwaukee than a billion-dollar auction house in Manhattan?

The trade in ancient objets d'art always has involved more than a little piracy. If it didn't, we wouldn't have had the British Museum all these years. And there also is the memorable episode involving the Green family and their Museum of the Bible, in which the Good Christian Folk of the Hobby Lobby fortune allegedly went into business with smugglers.

The new legislation calls for a study on the role of art in money laundering and terror financing. (A recent Senate report has already outlined how at least two Russian oligarchs had exploited the opaqueness of the art world to bypass U.S. sanctions.) If the study finds a link between the art market and illicit activity, it could, upon congressional review, trigger the creation of rules similar to the ones now concerning the antiquities trade. Regulators have also signaled that the Bank Secrecy Act could be further extended into the art market.

Excavations carried out in 2020 uncovered all sorts of exciting surprises, despite the challenges of the health crisis, which required stringent safety measures and resulted in fewer hands in the field, especially archaeology students and volunteers from abroad.

Epidaurus

One of the most exciting pieces of archaeological news in 2020 came from excavations around the tholos building at the Sanctuary of Asclepius in Epidaurus in the eastern Peloponnese, which began roughly a year ago with the discovery of an Archaic structure by the team of Vassilis Lambrinoudakis, professor emeritus of classical archaeology.

New finds made in the area point to the existence of a chthonic residence of the god dating back to his earliest presence at Epidaurus. They also indicate that Asclepius' presence in the area dates back much further than believed. The unidentified building - which had a ground floor and basement with a mosaic floor and colonnade - was built in the same area as the emblematic 4th century BC tholos building.

Despotiko

The tiny, 8-kilometer island off the southwestern coast of Antiparos in the Cyclades continued to offer important treasures in 2020, as did the adjacent rock of Tsimintiri, which was connected to Despotiko in ancient times. Apart from the discovery of a 10 structures, archaeologists working at the two sites focused their efforts on the restoration of an Archaic temple dedicated to Apollo.

Work was also carried out for improving accessibility with the construction of wheelchair ramps at Despotiko, while more restorations have been planned for 2021.

Rineia

Much of the year on Rineia - the mysterious and cloistered site that has been in the shadow of sacred Delos for so long - has been dedicated to the important task of mapping the island's geomorphology and identifying the exact locations of its artifacts.

According to the director of the Cyclades Ephorate of Antiquities, Dimitris Athanasoulis, this is the first effort ever made to fully document the site and create a framework for its archaeological profile. The work has uncovered ancient farmhouses, an unknown road and the traces of a large altar, while also yielding shards of bird sculptures and sections of steles.

Zominthos

A small part of a gold sheet uncovered by a rainstorm on Crete compelled archaeologist Efi Sapouna-Sakellaraki to raise a stone layer of an altar found at the palace complex of the Athens Archaeological Society's excavations at Zominthos, around 7 kilometers west of Anogeia. This led to the discovery of a burned tree trunk, lined with 90 gold sheets, and small plates, which must have been attached to the altar or scattered around it.

According to the archaeologist, findings indicate that area in the northern foothills of Mount Ida (Psiloritis) was once ""inhabited by the descendants of the Knossos dynasty"" and was ""an important economic, religious and cultural center."" The two-, perhaps even three-story, main building was in use from at least 2000 BC.

Kydonia

Archaeologists working on the palace complex of Kydonia in Hania, Crete, uncovered the deepest part of a trench used for sacrifices that tallies with the earlier discovery of the remains of animal offerings and those of a young girl dating to Mycenaean times, in the 13th century BC.

The trench is also believed to be responsible for the collapse of the sacrificial altar, as fragments of flooring were found inside it. Archaeologist Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki, meanwhile, told Kathimerini that even though the complex was likely destroyed by a massive earthquake just before the mid-13th century BC, digs in 2020 indicated that it was built before the mid-14th century BC.

Athens

The discovery in downtown Athens, at number 25 Aeolou Street, across the road from the Church of Agia Irini in Psyrri, of the head of an ancient statue depicting the god Hermes was one of the most surprising findings of the year. It was exciting news mainly because the discovery was made during work on the sewerage system by the municipal authority, under the supervision of the City of Athens Ephorate of Antiquities. The head is believed to date to the late 4th or early 3rd century BC and is impressive for the good state it was found in.

Underwater museum

The year 2020 saw the inauguration of Greece's first underwater museum, near the uninhabited islet of Peristera off the eastern coast of Alonissos in the northwestern Aegean.

The launch of the museum allows amateur archaeologists and divers to explore the area on guided tours carried out by certified centers on Alonissos. The highlight of the tour is a 425 BC shipwreck that contained around 4,000 wine vessels.

Repatriations

Greece scored an important victory in 2020 with the return of an 8th century BC bronze equestrian statue that was due to go under the hammer at Sotheby's. The Greek side had filed an official request with the auction house so that the artifact could be returned to Greece and while Sotheby's withdrew the item from auction, it also took legal action against the Greek state in a court in New York in June.

The Greek Culture Ministry, however, persisted with its claim of ownership of the artifact, and was vindicated with what Minister Lina Mendoni described as a ""massive international success in the fight against the illegal antiquities trade."" The reason is that the American court's ruling in favor of Greece is an important precedent for any country seeking the return of historical items that have been looted and are being put up for sale.

Greece also saw the return of five rare silver coins dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BC that were returned before being auctioned off in Munich and Zurich. The three from Munich are a stater from Lindos (Rhodes) from the first half of the 5th century BC, an octadrachm of Getas, the king of Edonians in Thrace, dated to around 480-460 BC, and a stater from Elis, dated to around 328 BC. The other two, from Zurich, are an Athenian tetradrachm dated to 136 BC, and a tetradrachm of Ptolemy IV Philopator cut in Sidon around the end of the 3rd century BC.",6373011840,https://www.ekathimerini.com/260787/gallery/ekathimerini/life/for-archaeologists-at-least-2020-was-a-good-year,,,

The Syrian geography has experienced remarkable shifts of power and influence and military, political and economic changes, with no actor or military power in Syria could care less about lives of the people of Syria. Since January 1, 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has documented the deaths of 6,817 people, including 1528 civilians of whom there are 231 children and 197 women. This is the lowest yearly death toll ever since the start of the ""Syrian Revolution"".

In 2020, the Syria scene went through various developments reflected at all levels, including the political, economic and social . The most prominent developments in Syria in 2020 could be summarized in the following:

Ongoing arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances and kidnappings

With the prevalence of kidnap gangs, armed militias and groups, arrests and forced disappearances of men, women and children continued throughout Syria, no matter which power dominates which area. In 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitored and tracked kidnappings across Syria and managed to document 512 incidents of kidnapping, including 61 children and 53 women. Most of these kidnapped civilians are still detained, and a few others were released after having paid ransoms, while 43 civilians, including two children and five women, had already been killed by their kidnappers. It is worth noting that regime-controlled areas have topped the list of kidnappings in 2020, with 198 incidents, followed by areas under the control of Turkish forces and their proxy factions with 183 incidents, then SDF-held areas with more than 92 incidents. While the smallest number of incidents of kidnapping has been recorded in areas under the control of rebel and jihadi factions with 39 incidents. Also, SOHR documented the deaths of 119 Syrian civilians under torture in regime prisons.

Syrian women: extra burdens and deprivation of rights

The ongoing violence and hostilities in Syria in 2020 had touched the lives of Syrian women, as the recent dire conditions have affected women psychologically and socially. The Syrian Observatory has been continuously focusing on the sufferings of Syrian women, which can be summarised in the following main points:

Moreover, Syria's war has created a very bitter reality and left negative psychological impacts on Syrian women, as the absence of social security, struggle with unstable conditions, torture, detention and violence made Syrian women vulnerable to psychological trauma, including permanent fear, anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies and withdrawal, especially with the lack of psychological and mental health treatment, and limited medical capabilities and resources.

Syria's Children: A bitter present and uncertain future!

As the Syrian crisis, with its ongoing violent and bloody fighting, mass displacement and crippling social and economic consequences, the children of Syria have emerged as its biggest losers; and they are the real and true victims of this tragic conflict, for they are the ones who live a bitter present and potentially face an uncertain and bleak future.

In 2020, SOHR highlighted the unabating suffering and plight of the children of Syria, chief among them were:

Economic, social and political consequences of the deteriorating security and mounting human rights violations

Violations committed by all warring powers in Syria in 2020 have scarred the Syrian society on all levels, including the economic, social and political and can be summarized in the following main points:

Continuous corruption

The most prominent corruption files in 2020 was that of Rami Makhlouf, Bashar Al-Assad's tycoon cousin. Makhlouf was a key pillar of Al-Assad regime's economy, the financial executive arm of the regime, the regime's partner in looting the Syrian people's money and public funds, and one of the most important backers financing Al-Assasd's war effort since 2011. The rift between Rami Makhlouf on one hand, and the Syrian regime and the Russians on the other, started after the regime and Russians seized ""Al-Bostan Association"" in 2019 and dissolved all affiliated militias under the pretext of ""corruption"". At that time, the regime confiscated the funds of Rami Makhlouf and his mobile phone company ""Syriatel"", arrested officers, regime soldiers, managers, employees, technicians and fighters working for businesses and associations belonging to Rami Makhlouf, asked Makhlouf to pay funds owed to the ""Syrian Telecommunications Regulatory Authority"", and froze his assets under ""precautionary seizure"".

Rami Makhlouf has been accused of tax evasion and illicit enrichment during the Syrian war which started in 2011. Makhlouf, however, accused the security services of arresting employees working for his business in order to force him to give up and resign from his companies, particularly ""Syriatel"" company which controls nearly 70% of Syria's telecommunication market.

Most of employees in Makhlouf's companies, arrested by regime security services, were released later in September 2020, including 41 employees in ""Syriatel"" and 57 others in ""Al-Bostan Association"". Furthermore, 58 regime officers and soldiers who dealt and cooperated with Rami Makhlouf affiliated militias were also released.

Moreover, the entire Syrian geography, no matter which power dominates, struggled with poor surveillance and wide prevalent of corruption due to the extreme poverty, sanctions and Syrian currency plunge, which helped stockpiling, monopoly and black markets to ""flourish"". In the wake of sever crises in Syria in 2020, corruption noticeably escalated and prevailed even among top officials, as SOHR disclosed, in January 2020, several acts of corruption by officials of the ""Salvation Government"" via the ""Ministry of Development and Humanitarian Affairs"" which struck deals with humanitarian and aid organizations operating under its banner, seizing all support provided for these organizations and aid supplies allocated for displaced people, which later were sent to HTS fighters.

As for SDF-held areas, reliable sources informed SOHR on April 17 that fighters and commanders of ""Manbij Military Council"" were involved in smuggling operations between areas held by ""Euphrates Shield"" factions, and areas under the control of ""Manbij Military Council"", where the smuggled goods were sold for much higher prices. It is worth noting that the crossings of Tal Tamr, which have been prepared for such smuggling operations, are under supervision of Jaysh Al-Thwaar, Sh'aytat and SDF.

While in November 2020, reliable SOHR sources confirmed that officials in Al-Hawl camp and some members of the Internal Security Forces (Asayish) received bribes reached $4,000 each in return for helping 110 extremist ISIS women to move from their section inside Al-Hawl campin Al-Hasakah countryside, to other sections allocated for Syrian and Iraqis refugees. These officials also allowed the camp's inhabitants to bring in large sums of money over $200 which is officially allowed by the camp's administration

Recruitment operations and the transformation of Syrian fighters into mercenaries

In light of the sever economy hardship in Syria, some regional states have exploited and recruited many Syrians, turning them into mercenaries to guard and serve their own interests outside Syria. Russia, for example, has recruited nearly 3,000 Syrian fighters, via ""Wagner Security Group"" to fight in Libya onthe side of the ""Libyan National Army"", at the same time when Turkey has recruited 18,000 Syrian fighters, including 350 children under the age of 18, sending them also to Libya to fight alongside the ""Government of National Accord"". Additionally, Turkey has recruited 2,580 Syrian mercenaries thrown into battles in Azerbaijan. Not to mention the child recruitment operations by the SDF-backed ""Al-Shabiba Al-Thawriyah"" (Jawani Shourshokr) which kidnap children, forcing them to join its affiliated military groups.

Increasing forced mass displacement...shoddy and unfit refugee camps...""farcical"" Russian and regime-sponsored conference on refugees' return...regime efforts to profit from the plight of refugees stranded on Lebanon-Syria border

The fierce and violent battles among all warring parties in conflict zones in Syria led to the destruction of vital infrastructure almost completely, forcing more than half of Syria's population to displace to other areas in and outside Syria, as the Syrian civil war has been descried as the ""worst man-made disaster since World War II"". In this context, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented enforced displacement movements during the war, shedding light further on Al-Hawl camp which has become the largest refugee camp in Syria with nearly 70,000 displaced people and refugees living in it, mostly of whom fled from areas which had under the control of ISIS.

Another refugee camp on the Iraq-Syria-Jordan border triangle, Al-Rukban camp, is struggling with dire economic, social and medical situations, posing a threat to the lives of 11,000 displaced people living there. It is worth noting that Idlib and surrounding countryside experienced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people over the military operations by regime forces and the Russians. Meanwhile, displaced people in Harbanoush camp in northern Idlib, Talmannas camp in the west of Kafriya village in the north-eastern countryside of Idlib, and other makeshift camps in Deir Hassan village near the Syria border with the Iskenderun region in northern Idlib are suffering from similar disastrous humanitarian situation.

On February 16, the Syrian Observatory confirmed that the number of displaced people in Idlib and Aleppo exceeded two million, following the expansion of contested and fought over areas. The Russian and regime forces' latest military escalation in Idlib and Aleppo since mid-December 2019 led to the largest displacement wave ever, amid dire humanitarian situation in the wake of lack of minimum levels of basic livelihood and overpopulation in areas of displacement. While on July 14 SOHR activists monitored a new wave of displacement in Ariha city and other villages in Jabal Al-Zawiyah, as civilians were fleeing from the ongoing Russian airstrikes and intensive bombardment by regime ground forces, with tens of rockets and artillery shells hitting the areas. Idlib is one of the most overpopulated Syrian provinces with large numbers of displaced people and refugee camps, which drains the province's own economic resources and leads to the spread of various negative social phenomena, including the high ratio of poverty, unemployment, crimes and violence.

Furthermore, Syria has experienced several incidents of enforced displacement which aimed at changing the demographic structure of specific regions. One example, among many, is Turkey's demographic change in Afrin canton. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has monitored and tracked such changes in Syria which started in ""Al-Kedam"" neighbourhood in Damascus on March 13, 2018, and were followed by several displacement operations in accordance with deals and agreements between factions and representatives of the areas which experienced mass exodus on one hand, and Russian and regime forces on the other. The Syrian Observatory documented an estimated 120,000 displaced people who left their areas in eastern Ghouta, southern Damascus, southern Rif Dimashq, eastern Qalamoun, north Homs countryside and south Hama countryside, and headed to northern Syria region. Most of these displaced people moved to Afrin canton, and in turn, hundreds of thousands of Afrin inhabitants were forced to displace due to ""Peace Spring"" operation. After the Turkish-led operation, tens of thousands of displaced people were settled in the houses and farms that belonged to Afrin's indigenous Kurdish civilians who were forced to flee the violations and atrocities of Turkish forces and their proxy factions.

As for Syrian refugees, the Syrian regime exploited the plight of refugees stuck on the Syria-Lebanon border since March 23, 2020, the date of the closure of the Syria-Lebanon border crossings, when hundreds of Syrians living in Lebanon wanted to return to Syria after they had lost their income, along with the start of the coronavirus outbreaks. The Syrian regime's authorities issued ""Resolution No. 46"" on July 8, 2020 preventing Syrian citizens from entering Syria, unless a sum of 100 USD was handed over and exchanged, on arrival, into Syrian pound at an official rate set by the Syrian Central Bank. Such obstinate decisions and procedures by regime authorities led to the death of a Syrian girl on the Syria-Lebanon border.

On the other hand, Russia and Syrian regime allied nations insisted on holding an international conference on refugees' return in November. It is worth noting that the European Union member states, which host the bulk of Syrian refugees, as well as the United States boycotted the conference, while a United Nations representative attended as an observer. Meanwhile, the conference failed to find a workable solution for the refugees' hardship, especially with the ongoing killing, displacement and demographic change throughout Syria, let alone the major donors' shrinking funds allocated for Syria's post-war reconstruction, which would cost around $400 billion according to initial reports.

Increasing suicide cases

In light of the disastrous living conditions of most of Syrian people, SOHR has recorded 51 confirmed cases of suicide in Syria since the beginning of 2020, including 13 cases of children under the age of eighteen and eight cases of women, with Aleppo province topping the list of the number of suicides. Violence and protracted conflicted have greatly contributed to the increasing the number of people whose dire conditions forced them to kill themselves.

Aid suspension

Many factors have led to blocking and suspending aid supplies provided to many IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camp, which threatens Syria with unprecedented famine. Some prominent reasons behind depriving Syrian people from aid allocations can be summarised in the following:

And as a part of the ""politicization"" of humanitarian aid delivery into Syria, vital aid supplies have been blocked as the United Nations Security Council failed to extend permission for humanitarian aid to be delivered via crossings on the Turkey border, because of the Russian-Chinese veto. Moscow has insisted on reducing the number of border crossings to one, Bab Al-Hawa crossing in Idlib, arguing that 85 % of humanitarian aid supplies pass through this border crossing. Russia also wanted to shut down the other border crossing, Bab Al-Salama crossing in Azaz in northern Aleppo.

Poor healthcare

The protracted conflict in Syria has left serious unforeseen consequences regarding the medical sector, including the following:

It is worth noting that most of Syria's resources goes into armament, while 70% of health and medical services and hospitals have been put out of services due to the military operations.

SOHR had cited the World Health Organization's warning and concern considering the rapid outbreak of the novel coronavirus, especially in refugee camps. The Syrian Observatory has tracked the development of coronavirus pandemic, documenting the confirmed infections and deaths across Syria, which were regionally distributed in late 2020 as follows:

Deteriorating education and Ideological curricula

Education is a sector which has had the largest share of damage and destruction due to bombardment and displacement, with a large number of those displaced being children, where children are either dropping out or stay in education but facing obstacles hindering their education. The deteriorating education in Syria could be attributed to many factors, including the destruction of infrastructure, low funds, lack of teachers, fragile curricula, and high rate of illiteracy. One example, among many, of deterioration of education is the ""politicized and ideological"" curricula provided by the Autonomous Administration in their controlled areas. Accordingly, some residents refuse to send their children to schools in these areas. Besides, military powers control some schools and educational centres in Autonomous Administration's held areas. Moreover, the certificates are not recognized in areas outside the control of the Autonomous Administration, which means that such certificates will be useless if their holders decided to move to another area inside Syria or another country.

Repression and violations against media activists

The Syrian Observatory has monitored and tracked repression and violations against journalists, media practitioners and activists whose job is to document violations committed by the various warring parties against the Syrian people. Such violations included prosecution of Syrian, Arab and foreign journalists, threats of killing, arrests, enforced disappearances and killing. From March 15, 2011 to November 16, 2020, SOHR activists documented the death of 748 Syrian journalists. Furthermore, 100 journalists were killed by ISIS and opposition rebel, Islamic and jihadi factions, and here is a quick breakdown:

Also, 38 journalists have been abducted and forcibly disappeared in areas under the control of opposition factions and Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham. SOHR has also documented a blatant violation against journalists by Turkish forces, when two journalists within a convoy in Ras Al-Ain city were killed during the Turkish-backed military operation ""Peace Spring"".

In regime-held areas, however, SOHR activists say that Al-Assad's regime has been clamping down on and arresting Syrian as well as foreign journalists who criticize the regime, oppose its policy or go into issues of corruption. Regime forces and their proxy militias have killed 541 Syrian journalists and eight foreign journalists. Among the total number of journalists killed by the Syrian regime there were seven females as well as five SOHR activists killed in Latakia, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Damascus and Rif Dimashq; while 56 other journalists died under torture in regime prisons. Additionally, Russian aircraft have killed 29 Syrian journalists.

On the other hand, SDF-held areas have also witnessed violations against journalists and media activists. SOHR sources have confirmed the deaths of six activists killed by SDF members, while five journalists had disappeared in SDF-held areas and their fate remained known. While the International Coalition aircraft killed three Syrian journalists, including a journalist who was working as an activist at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Raqqa city.

SDF-held areas: Signing oil deals with U.S. amid regime condemnation...unprecedented escalation in Ain Issa at the end of the year

SDF's new deals with the United States concerning the petroleum sector in eastern Euphrates region led to the signing of an agreement between Syria Democratic Forces and ""Delta Crescent Energy"", seemingly an ad-hoc American oil company, in late July 2020. The new agreement stipulates maintaining, developing and modernizing oil fields in SDF-held areas, in addition to providing two mobile refineries which are planned to process nearly 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

In an effort by Washington to control Syria's oil, as most of oil fields are located in Deir Ezzor and Al-Hasakah provinces in north and east Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian regime has rejected these deals, while Russia, Turkey and Iran criticised them, with the refusal of the people of Deir ez-Zor, which comprises an Arab majority.

In this context, the Syrian Observatory monitored security tensions in Deir ez-Zor which resulted in human losses, especially of oil workers, in addition to attacks on tribal elders in Deir ez-Zor, where the Syrian Observatory documented a number of assassinations attempts on tribal elders and sheikhs in the area.

The Syrian Observatory also documented several assassinations targeting tribal elders and dignitaries in Deir Ezzor.

On July 31, 2020, ISIS claimed responsibility for the killing of ""Ali Suleiman Al-Hamadah"", the official spokesperson for ""Al-Ekaydat tribe"", in Al-Busayrah town in eastern Deir Ezzor. It is worth noting that ""Al-Ekaydat"" is a large Arab tribe which dominates the Near Euphrates region with some 500,000 members and affiliates.

On August 1, gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying dignitaries of ""Ekaydat"" tribe, including ""Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Hafal"" and ""Sheikh Matshar Al-Hafal"", the uncle of the head of ""Ekaydat"" tribe and one of the owners of the land where Al-Omar oil field is located. The attack, which took place in Theban town in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, resulted in the death of ""Sheikh Matshar Al-Hafal"" and the car's driver, while ""Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Hafal"" sustained serious injuries.

Another attack targeted ""Ali Al-Salman Al-Bakari"" the head of Al-Dahla village in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, he is also a senior dignitary of ""Al-Bakarah"" tribe, one of the largest Arab tribes in the region.

In this context, the ""Ekaydat"" tribe held SDF responsible for the series of assassinations against tribal elders and dignitaries, as SDF did not adopt the needed measures or procedures in order to control the security situation and put an end to the assassinations in areas under their control.

Moreover, SOHR activists monitored IN MONTH growing popular anger as well as the escalating protests and demonstrations in the wake of these repeated assassinations in the towns of Al-Shuhayl, Dheban and Al-Hawayej.

On the other hand, SDF-held had occasionally been subjected to military operations and attacks by Turkish forces and their proxy factions, disrupting stability in the region, increasing unrest, depleting more resources and fuelling public discontent. The strategic town of Ain Issa has been witnessing an unprecedented Turkish military escalation since November 10 to this date, through shelling and attacks in an attempt to cut off the Hasakeh-Aleppo road.

On December 24, 2020, SOHR activists documented a significant rise in the death toll of Turkish-backed factions due to Ain Issa's ambush in Al-Raqqah governorate in the SDF-held area. Where SDF set up an ambush in the village of Ma'alaq near Ain Issa, planting landmines. Meanwhile, the factions carried out an infiltration attempt as SDF withdraw from the village. The ambush killed 31 fighters of the factions.

Despite counter attacks by Coalition forces and their Syria Democratic Forces partner, in addition to security campaigns by Russian and regime forces against ISIS cells, ISIS continues launching attacks on regime forces and SDF in areas under their control.

ISIS cells continue their escalating activities in various areas in the Syrian desert, targeting regime forces and loyal militias through ambushes, explosions and surprise attacks, inflecting human and material losses on regime forces.

This resurgence happened despites the considerable support by Russian and regime jets through airstrikes on ISIS position.

The escalating military operations were concentrated in Aleppo-Hama-Al-Raqqah triangle, in addition to the deserts of Homs and Deir Ezzor.

These areas were witnessing daily military operations, as Russians and regime forces are trying to put an end to ISIS escalating activities.

According to SOHR statistics, ISIS managed to kill 819 regime soldiers and loyal militiamen in 2020, including 108 Iranian-backed non-Syrian militiamen, in ambushes, attacks, shelling and clashes in the Syrian desert. Also, ISIS lost 507 fighters in clashes and airstrikes by Russian and regime fighter jets in the same period.

Meanwhile, ISIS cells in SDF-held areas were numerous and widely active, moving in the region ""comfortably"" despite the security campaigns by SDF and the International Coalition.

SOHR activists documented more than 480 operations by ISIS cells in SDF-controlled areas in Deir Ezzor, Al-Hasakah, Al-Raqqah and Manbij in 2020. These operations, including detonations, ambushes and attacks, claimed the lives of 208 persons: 86 civilians, including 10 children and six women, and 122 SDF fighters.

In 2020, the Syrian Observatory monitored the participation of the International Coalition in tens of SDF security campaigns through raids and airdrops in eastern Euphrates region, mostly in Deir Ezzor. During these operations, 113 persons were arrested for ""belonging to ISIS"", including several ISIS commanders. Also, SDF and International Coalition Forces killed eight ISIS cells' members, including former commanders. Moreover, SOHR sources have confirmed that tens of people had been arrested by SDF and International Coalition under the pretext of tracking down the group.

However, these security campaigns failed to end ISIS cells' activities. The Syrian Observatory also monitored many ISIS operations, including killings, assassinations, bombings and attacks, as well as asking civilians to pay zakat by sending messages on WhatsApp and threatening them.

As for ISIS's abductees, all sides remain quiet and provide no clarification on the fate of thousands of abductees, where fear continues to grow for the lives and fate of the abductees, including Father Paolo Daololio, Bishops John Ibrahim and Paul Yazji, Abdullah Al Khalil, a British journalist, sky news journalist and other journalists, in addition to hundreds of abductees from Ain Al Arab (Kobane) area and Afrin, as well as the people of Deir ez-Zor. The Syrian Observatory has called on the leaders of the International Coalition and SDF to make the outcome of investigations with the group's prisoners public.

Turkey's role in Syria: Escalating violations in Afrin, hidden ties to ISIS-linked military brigades and withdrawals from regime-held areas

During2020, Turkey continued to push deeper into Syrian territories.

On 25 February 2020, SOHR monitored Turkey's land-grab attempts to expand its border further into Afrin and annex more Syrian territories in order to achieve several goals, the most prominent of which was expanding its borders on the outskirts of Balya village of Bulbala town to a distance exceeding 315 meters.

On June 7, 2020, very reliable sources provided the Syrian Observatory with detailed information about a battalion which consists of nearly 40 Iraqi fighters, operates under the banner of ""Ahrar Al-Sharqiyyah"" faction, and works for the Turkish intelligence..

According to SOHR sources, the battalion works in northern Syria with a task of carrying out assassinations, executions and detonations.

Moreover, the Iraqi battalion used to bury people it killed in a mass grave on the outskirts of Susanbat village on the road between Al-Bab and Al-Ra'i in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo. SOHR has obtained information about the fact that this battalion had killed nearly 300 civilians, combatants and ISIS members buried in the battalion's mass grave in Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory highlighted all Turkish withdrawals from observation posts in areas annexed recently by regime forces, as out of 12 main Turkish posts in north-western Syria region, Turkish forces completely evacuated the following five posts:

While there were four other main Turkish posts out of regime-controlled areas, and they are as follows:

As for the recently-established Turkish posts, SOHR activists reported that Turkish forces completely withdrew from the following four posts: Maar Hattat and Al-Sena'a in the east of Saraqeb in rural Idlib, Al-Kurani factory in Al-Zarbah, and Qubaytan Al-Jabal in Aleppo countryside. Furthermore, Turkish forces continued dismantling equipment in Al-Duwayr post in northern Saraqeb in preparations to evacuate it.

It is worth noting that Turkish forces are still stationed in several posts established recently in regime-controlled areas, including the grain warehouse in the south of Saraqeb, Al-Sayromat factory in northern Saraqeb, Tarnabeh in western Saraqeb, and another post in Aleppo countryside near Kafr Halab.

Turkish-backed areas:Seizure of civilians' land and properties, imposition of levies and theft of antiquities and worship places

Violations against residents in the ""Peace Spring"" and ""Olive Branch"" areas continued to mountin 2020.

Since taking control of the area in October 2019, the Turkish-backed factions have been committing violations, stealing and looting civilians' property, including the seizure of land and farms and the stealing agricultural equipment. They also prevented farmers from cultivating their land in villages on the frontlines separating Turkish-backed factions and SDF-held, villages such as Al-Mahmoudiyyah, Aniq Al-Hawa, Al-Qasimiyyah and Al-Rayhaniyyah, near Tal Tamr area in the northern countryside of Al-Hasakah.

Moreover, ""Al-Hamzaat Division"" had seized agricultural land owned by more than 100 families with an area of 30 hectare in Ras al-Ain countryside in the areas of ""Peace Spring"" in Hasakeh countryside.

According to SOHR sources, the villages captured by the al-Hamzaat Division were: ""Qatina, Al-Hardana, Al-Dawiri, Masajid and Tal al-Barm"". Al-Hamzaat Division cultivates civilian land and steals its produce.

On the other hand, people's complaints and anger were increasing due to the imposition of high levies by the factions. The people of the southern countryside of Ras Al Ain complained of the imposition of levies in unspecified amounts on passers-by at the checkpoints of Um al-Debs, Kua Shallah and Al-Mushirfeh.

In the areas of ""Putin-Erdogan"", the Salvation Government's General Authority of Zakat appointed an official in every olive pressing factory in areas under its control in order to collect ""zakat"" for the second consecutive year, since residents were forced to give this official an estimated 5% of the oil production. People refusing to pay had been threatened with arrest by security services or HTS-affiliated police outposts.

Meanwhile, a supervisory body affiliated to Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham monitored the work of those officials and imposed large penalties on those seen as lenient officials, despite a significant decline in olive crops and oil production in 2020.

In the areas of the ""Olive Branch"", the factions of ""Falcons of the North"", ""Al-Muntasir Billah"" and ""Suleiman Shah"", known as ""Abu Amsha"", and ""Al-Jabha Al-Shamiya"" imposed levies on the people during the olive season and confiscated their production. The Syrian Observatory monitored 250 seizures of homes and shops by factions in Afrin in 2020.

On the other hand, the places of worship have not been exempt from vandalism and looting, as members of Turkish-backed factions looted the contents of the ""Mar Touma"" Syriac Church in Churches neighbourhood in Ras al-Ain within the ""Peace Spring"" areas in Al-Hasakeh countryside.

Meanwhile, SOHR sources have confirmed that members of the regime-backed 5 Corps have stormed a mosque in Al-Baq'aa neighbourhood in the west of Al-Lajat area in the eastern countryside of Daraa, destroying the mosque's ""minbar"" (a pulpit in a mosque where the imam stands to deliver sermons) and sabotaging its contents. Moreover, the regime-backed militiamen prevented the residents from entering the mosque or even get close to it under the pretext that the mosque and its facilities be used by regime forces only.

Turkish-backed factions' violations have extended to religious and archaeological sites as well, and the Syrian Observatory has exposed ongoing archaeological excavations, acts of vandalism and destruction of religious shrines in search for antiques. The factions have vandalized more than 25 archaeological sites, searching for antiquities, as they relied on inexperienced workers who used tools and means that were not commensurate with these delicate works. Not to mention the smuggling of Syria's artifacts to Turkey where they are sold for large sums of money.

In mid-April, reliable sources informed the Syrian Observatory that militants of ""Sultan Suleiman Shah"" faction, known as ""Al-Amshat"", began excavations and search for antiquities on the archaeological hill of Arnada in ""Al-Sheikh Hadid"" area in the western countryside of Afrin. Furthermore, the hill was exposed to excavation work almost daily by members of ""Sultan Suleiman Shah"" using heavy diggers. Such excavations and random search for antiquities caused significant damage and massive destruction to the hill. Similarly, ""Sheikh",,,,,
"Hamid"""" shrine", located in the village of Qastal Jando in Sharran district in Afrin countryside, experienced similar excavations and sabotage. It is worth noting that this shrine is a holy place for Yazidi Kurds and is also frequented by the region's Muslims, and it is also a historical monument of Afrin canton. Residents of the canton accused members of Turkish-backed factions of such excavations, with the full knowledge and consent of Turkish intelligence which often facilitated these actions.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turkish-backed factions, supported by Turkish forces, cut down forests and trees in the village of Routanli in Ma'abatli district," after taking approval from the Turkish-backed """"Samarkand"""" faction there.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In mid-March 2020, Observatory sources reported that members of Turkish-backed factions cut down a large number of trees in Al-Mahmoudiyah neighbourhood in the centre of Afrin, as factions' members continued to cut down trees in various areas in countryside.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the """"de-escalation zone""""", Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham and factions work widely in excavation for antiquities in Idlib and its surrounding areas, where the province is witnessing a widespread antiquities trade, particularly with the facilities provided by Turkish officers in order to smuggles and sells these antiquities in Turkey.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strengthening Russian presence in Syria through ongoing support for Assad regime, agreements with Turkey and attempts to exclude Iran from the scene,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has sought to strengthen its presence in Syria and maximise its gains by supporting regime forces in their military operations in Aleppo and Idlib against jihadist factions, as well as in the Syrian desert against ISIS.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Aleppo and Idlib, Russian support enabled regime forces to capture 3000 areas at the beginning of the year, and took full control of the Damascus-Aleppo international road, after which the Russians reached understandings with the Turkish side by signing an agreement between the two parties on March 5,2020, in Moscow," known as the """"de-escalation zone"""" agreement.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
The agreement stipulated the following: announcement of a temporary ceasefire, establishing a security corridor and conducting joint Turkish-Russian patrols on the Latakia-Aleppo international road, resulting in 26 joint patrols in 2020, as Russia sought to preserve its own interests and presence on Syrian international roads.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Additionally, Russia had been conducting joint patrols with the Turks in NE Syria, and strengthening its presence on the Hasaka-Aleppo international road in order to consolidate its influence in the Syrian oil-reach areas, and in American-backed areas, seeking to shift the balance of power in Syria in its favour.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia was also seeking to implement a policy of """"interim dominance"""" by controlling Iranian strongholds in southern Aleppo countryside", and redeploying around Idlib region.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Furthermore, Russia had apparently given tacit consent to Israeli strikes on Iranian strongholds in Syria in order to curb Iranian influence in the eastern Euphrates and the desert region and to end Tehran's military presence in Syria.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also," Russia carried out intensive airstrikes on areas under the control of the factions under the pretext of countering """"terrorist organizations"""".",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the Russian desire to change the balance of power in Syria, and particularly in the provinces of Al-Suwayda and Daraa," through its """"Fifth Corps"""" was clear for all to observe.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2020, SOHR activists documented the deaths of 1,236 people in aerial and rocket attacks by Russian forces on different positions across Syria. The fatalities were distributed as follows:,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
On December 10, Russian forces opened their first headquarters in Al-Bokamal city in eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, near the Syria-Iraq border.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Russian-backed """"5 Corps"""" started to deploy its forces in several posts on the Syria-Iraq border near Al-Bokamal city. It is worth noting that several Iranian-backed militias", including Al-Nujabaa' Movement," the Iraqi Hezbollah and """"Al-Abdal""""", had handed over several posts to the 5 Corps, in accordance with a Russian-Iranian agreement, in reference to the end of the Russian-Iranian cold war.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
That support was reflected through an agreement between Tehran and Damascus on strengthen military and security cooperation, under which Iran supplied Syria with its most modern weaponry, especially 3 Khordad air defence systems.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, Iranian forces continued recruiting more people to their ranks in southern Syria and western Euphrates region," as """"Shi'aism"""" proselytising operations (conversion to Shiite) were still underway in public through the offering of financial incentives and continuous usage of religion and sectarianism.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to SOHR statistics, the number of volunteers in southern Syria has exceeded 8,600. While the number of recent recruits in the ranks of Iranian forces and loyal militias in the west Euphrates region has risen to nearly 7,450 Syrian young males and adult men.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iranian militias intentionally intensify these recruitment operations," exploiting Russia's preoccupation with recent agreements with Turkey regarding the """"de-escalation zone"""" and north-eastern Syria.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Daraa province," the Iranians and Hezbollah continued recruiting more people via pro-Iranian spiritual figures in """"Saraya al-Areen"""" of the 313th Brigade in northern Daraa", and Shiite centres in Sayda, Da'el, Izraa. It is worth noting that the recent recruits undergo training courses in Al-Lajat area in eastern Daraa.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similarly, in Al-Quneitra, near the border with the occupied Syrian Golan, the Lebanese Hezbollah continued strengthening its presence by recruiting young people who had failed to join the mandatory and reserve military service of regime's security branches. In addition, the Iranians exploited the lack of job opportunities, attracting more people. Conversion to Shiite and recruitment operations are concentrated in Al-Baath city and Khan Arnabah.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
While in the west Euphrates region, recruitment was noticeably escalating in 2020 in the area from Al-Mayadin to Al-Bokamal in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, which is fully controlled by Iranian forces.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020 | Significant Israeli escalation on Syrian territory,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Israel continued to attack targets throughout Syrian , claiming that the Iranian presence in Syria and the support for Hezbollah threatened its security and exploiting the security chaos in the country," while the Syrian regime parroted it favourite cliché of """"reserving the right to respond to these attacks"""" as always.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2020, the Syrian Observatory monitored 39 Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, which was the largest escalation ever.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
The attacks were distributed as follows:,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
SOHR activists have documented the death of 213 people in these attacks, 42 of whom were Syrians, and 171 were of non-Syrian nationalities, and they are as follows:,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
An objective look at the Syrian scene in 2020 would show that the effects of humanitarian disasters and the Syrian crises have gone beyond Syria and its immediate region. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had warned of such effects at the beginning of the conflict in Syria in 2011. SOHR has appealed to the international community to intervene to stop the bloodshed and dangerous geopolitical conflict in Syria, and to save the world from its repercussions, which poses a threat to international peace and security.. The deaths of hundreds of thousands, the refugee crisis, smuggling operations and human trafficking across on the borders, and the crisis of radical organizations and their subversive members could have been avoided," had the international community acted swiftly.""",6372975508,https://www.syriahr.com/en/198765/,,,,

mongArt Industry News is a daily digest of the most consequential developments coming out of the art world and art market. Here's what you need to know on this Monday, January 4.

Artist Known for Defacing Art Basel Banana Settles With Trump - Rod Webber, the publicity-seeking prankster performance artist best known for scrawling the words ""Epstein Didn't Kill Himself"" across Maurizio Cattelan's viral banana installation at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2019, has reached a $20,000 settlement with the Trump campaign over a very different intervention. Webber was allegedly thrown ""head first"" into a table by a Trump campaign staffer when he tried to ask the then-presidential candidate a question during a New Hampshire campaign event in 2015. (Business Insider)

Louis Kahn-Designed Buildings in India Face Demolition - Plans to demolish the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad are on hold as the World Monuments Fund, among other heritage organizations, call on the institute's administration to reconsider. The buildings designed by one of America's most famed architects had, they say, considerable influence on ""modern development of Indian higher education."" The institute maintains that the dormitories are unlivable as slabs are falling off the roof, among other structural issues. (NYT)

Nashville Gallery Owner Vows to Rebuild - The owner of an art gallery in Nashville that was heavily damaged by the Christmas Day blast has vowed to rebuild and reopen. Ashley Bergeron Segroves, the founder of the Studio 208, says the ""lively"" downtown area now feels like a ""war zone."" But in a statement on her gallery's website, she noted that she felt fortunate -- she lives in back of the gallery and emerged unscathed. While she lost one major work, by local artist Kristin Llamas, ""the rest of our collection survived, even after many pieces were thrown across the room."" (Fox News)

The Architectural Paradox of Berlin's Humboldt Forum - The €633 million building in Berlin is controversial from most angles, but even based on its architecture alone, there are plenty of issues. Top of the list: the building lies on the rubble of the East German Palast der Republik, ""a museum in itself,"" laments FT's architecture critic Edwin Heathcote. The former East German parliament building was destroyed after German reunification under the pretense of asbestos (similar buildings had the toxin removed without being razed). The new palace ""now sits at the dead center of Berlin and has created exactly that: a dead center."" (Financial Times)

Congress Due to Apply New Regulations to Antiquities Market - The National Defense Authorization Act, which the US Congress passed on Friday by overriding President Trump's veto, has some art trade-relevant material in the fine print. The sprawling bill contains a move to broaden the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, which increased federal scrutiny of financial transactions, to include the trade of ancient artifacts. (NYT)

National Gallery Adds Works by Black Artists - The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, has acquired 40 works from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation. The purchase, which was three years in the making, adds examples by 21 Black painters, quilters, and sculptors to the museum's collection, including works by Lonnie Holley, Mary Lee Bendolph, and Thornton Dial.

Another Monolith Is Here - Oh, I'm sorry, you thought we could leave monolith mania behind in 2020? No such luck. Yet another silvery metal column -- what is it now, the fifth? -- has joined the fray, materializing near Salisbury in Wiltshire, UK, on New Year's Day. It was first discovered by a dog walker and, before long, began attracting attention on social media. (The Art Newspaper)

Director Named for Saudi Arabia's National Museum - Laila Alfaddagh has been tapped to lead Saudi Arabia's National Museum. From 2010 to 2017, she served as secretary of the King Abdul Aziz Center for World Culture. (Artforum)

Indigenous Museum Leader Marshall McKay Dies - The Northern California Indigenous leader of Pomo-Wintun heritage, who served as the first Indigenous chairman on the board of the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, died at 68 due to complications from COVID-19. A founding member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, McKay was described by the Autry's director as ""one of the five -- maybe even three -- significant Native leaders in the late 20th century and early 21st century.""

Chris Ofili on Philip Guston - The British artist -- no stranger to inciting controversy -- penned an essay on Philip Guston's 1969 painting City Limits, which depicts three hooded Klansmen riding in a car. ""Somehow, the sun never sets in this painting,"" Ofili writes, ""but also, no matter how long I stare at the horizon, the sun never rises to shed light on the dark slots of the eyeholes and windows.""

Art Enters Penn Station - Penn Station has long been the thorn in the side of many New Yorkers -- a necessary evil to get where one needs to go. But as part of a long-in-the-works overhaul, the new Moynihan Train Hall is welcoming permanent installations by such celebrated artists as Kehinde Wiley, Stan Douglas, and the duo Elmgreen & Dragset.

The House of Representatives passed the bill on Monday by a vote of 322 to 87. The Senate vote was 81 to 13, with 6 Senators not voting.

The NDAA allocates the money Congress has appropriated for the military, and since Congress passed the first NDAA in 1961, it has never failed to pass.

This measure pushed back on a number of the president's policies and demands. He wanted to be able to sue social media companies for things other people post on them -- the law preventing such lawsuits is in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act -- but even staunch Trump supporter James Inhofe (R-OK) refused, noting that Section 230 has nothing to do with the military. Trump objected to the measure in the bill that requires renaming military bases that currently bear the name of Confederate generals; Congress left it in. Congress also specified that federal authorities must ""visibly display"" their name tags when operating in public, a rebuke to the administration's deployment of officers in unmarked clothing this summer.

The NDAA also challenges Trump's policies by slowing or stopping the removal of troops from Germany and Afghanistan, making it harder to move troops to our southern border, and blocking the removal of troops from South Korea unless the Pentagon signs off on the move. It caps at $100 million the amount of money the military can use on domestic projects, a protest of the president's decision to fund his wall by moving $3.6 billion from other projects.

The NDAA also contains strong anti-corruption measures. Originally passed as the Corporate Transparency Act, these measures prohibit so-called shell companies with secret owners and operators, key tools of criminals and money launderers. The NDAA also regulates the antiquities trade, another haven for money laundering. The director of Transparency International's U.S. office, Gary Kalman, called the bill ""one of the most important anti-corruption measures ever passed by the U.S. Congress.""

After the Senate repassed the bill, Trump took to Twitter to call the Republican Senate ""Pathetic!!!""

As the veto override indicates, the war between Trump and establishment Republicans is now out in the open. On the one hand are lawmakers who are publicly backing Trump and his on-going attempt to overturn the election; on the other hand are Republicans who don't want to sign on to an assault on our democracy that, if it succeeds, would make Trump a dictator and remove all their power.

House lawmakers have indicated they will challenge some of the state electoral votes for Biden when Congress counts them on January 6. The process of gerrymandering, which protects Republicans from moderate challengers but leaves them open to challenges from extremists, has put a number of Republican radicals in the House, but the Senate has far fewer of them. A challenge from one house of Congress does not do anything, but a challenge to a state's electoral votes from both the House and the Senate means that both houses must debate whether or not to accept the electoral votes from that state. Then they decide by a simple majority vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has tried to keep Senate Republicans from challenging any of the votes because he doesn't want Republicans to have to go on record either for or against the president. The election was not close. Biden won by more than 7 million votes and by 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. The Trump campaign has either lost or had dismissed 60 of the 61 cases it has brought over the election, and its advisers are increasingly unhinged.

Today, for example, a Trump-appointed federal judge threw out a lawsuit filed by Louie Gohmert (R-TX) that sought to empower Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden's victory. Pence had opposed the lawsuit, and after the judge ruled, attorney Lin Wood, who is a supporter of the Trump effort, bizarrely predicted that Vice President Mike Pence could ""face execution by firing squad"" for ""treason."" (Twitter suspended his account.) Trump himself today retweeted an 8-minute video claiming that the Communist Party in China has secretly infiltrated America through Hollywood and newspapers and has bought Joe Biden. It urges ""patriots"" to defend America. To the tweet, Trump added: ""January 6th. See you in D.C.""

It seems clear that, with no chance of proving this election fraudulent, Trump is now trying to incite violence. Nonetheless, Republicans who are jockeying for the 2024 presidential nomination want to make sure they can pick up Trump's voters. While McConnell doesn't want Senators to have to declare their support either way, those vying to lead the party want to differentiate themselves from the pack.

On Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) announced he would join the efforts of his House colleagues to challenge Biden electors from Pennsylvania and perhaps other states. This will not affect the outcome of the election, but it will force senators to go on record for or against Trump. In a statement, Hawley listed Trump talking points: the influence of ""mega corporations"" on behalf of Biden and ""voter fraud."" Hawley seems pretty clearly to be angling for a leg up in 2024.

On Wednesday night, Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) made his own play for the future of the Republican Party. He refuted point by point the idea that Trump won. He scolded his colleagues who are signing on to Trump's attempt to steal the election, calling them ""institutional arsonists.""

""When we talk in private, I haven't heard a single Congressional Republican allege that the election results were fraudulent - not one,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Instead, I hear them talk about their worries about how they will ""look"" to President Trump's most ardent supporters."" They think they can ""tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage,"" he wrote, but they're wrong. ""Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.""

Today, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his own bid to redefine the Republican Party with an attack on Trump's apparent botching of the coronavirus vaccine rollout. In a press release, Romney noted ""[t]hat comprehensive vaccination plans have not been developed at the federal level and sent to the states as models is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.""

But he didn't stop there. Romney went on to say that he was no expert on vaccine distribution, ""[b]ut I know that when something isn't working, you need to acknowledge reality and develop a plan -- particularly when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake."" He offered ideas of his own, offering them ""not as the answer but as an example of the kind of options that ought to be brainstormed in Washington and in every state."" After listing his ideas, he concluded: ""Public health professionals will easily point out the errors in this plan -- so they should develop better alternatives based on experience, modeling and trial.""

Romney's statement was about more than vaccine distribution. With its emphasis on listening to experts and experimenting, it was an attack on the rigid ideology that has taken over the Republican Party. Romney has said he comes to his position from his own experience, not his reading, but he is reaching back to the origins of conservative thought, when Irish statesman Edmund Burke critiqued the French Revolution as a dangerous attempt to build a government according to an ideology, rather than reality. Burke predicted that such an attempt would inevitably result in politicians trying to force society to conform to their ideology. When it did not, they would turn to tyranny and violence.

41,:Article,news,US poised to apply banking regulations to antiquities market,138538438,2021-01-02T05:31:00Z,0.02745098,"New York: The antiquities trade, which regulators have long feared provided fertile ground for money laundering and other illicit activities, will be subject to greater oversight under legislation passed by Congress on Friday when it overrode President Donald Trump's veto.

The provisions tightening scrutiny of the antiquities market were contained within the sprawling National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump vetoed last week and which the House and Senate voted to override on Monday and on Friday.

Regulators have long worried that the opacity of the antiquities trade, where buyers and sellers are seldom identified, even to the parties in a transaction, made it an easy way to shroud illicit transfers of money. The new legislation empowers federal regulators to design measures that would remove secrecy from transactions.

Money laundering risk

""We believe this type of legislation is long overdue,"" said John Byrne, a lawyer with 30 years of experience in anti-money-laundering rules. ""This is an area where clearly organized crime, terrorists, and oligarchs have used cultural artifacts to move illicit funds.""

Dealers resisted the move. But with the new legislation, Congress moved to broaden the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, which increased federal scrutiny of financial transactions, to include the trade of ancient artifacts.

Exactly how the new law works will be determined over the next year by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau within the Treasury Department, in consultation with the private sector, law enforcement and the public. Legal experts expect that the new antiquities regulations will be similar to others governing the precious metal and jewelry industries, where certain transactions are flagged to the authorities, who then determine whether they are suspicious. The law also seeks to end the use of shell companies to conceal the identities of buyers and sellers.

Urgent need for reforms

Sponsors of the new measure described it as a much-needed reform.

""Over the last decade, we've been working with all the industries and stakeholders to build a bill that satisfies everyone,"" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who introduced the Corporate Transparency Act in 2019 and later shepherded that bill into the defense package. ""We are at a point that we've built so much support that it became impossible to oppose the bill.""

The Corporate Transparency Act faced opposition from antiquities dealers, who balked at the requirement to disclose client information and at the added costs of complying with the law. The art industry has fought similar legislation that would have extended the Bank Secrecy Act into the art market.

Federal disclosures show that the auction house Christie's has paid lobbyists more than $100,000 over the past two years to influence the outcomes of such measures. A spokesperson for the auction house, Erin McAndrew, said its compliance department already maintains standards to protect against money laundering that were adopted by the European Union in 2018.

She said that ""Christie's welcomes the opportunity to work with U.S. regulators on appropriate and enforceable"" guidelines to combat money laundering in the art market.

Long pending demand

Watchdogs have urged Congress to tighten regulations on the antiquities trade for years. The looting of cultural heritage sites in countries like Syria and Iraq has resulted in a growing black market for Middle Eastern antiquities. Law enforcement abroad has seized hundreds of artifacts, which officials believe trace back to earlier excavations carried out by terrorist groups like ISIS.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" said Tess Davis, executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, a nonprofit organization that monitors the illicit trade of artifacts.

""A pawnshop's business model does not differ greatly from that of a Sotheby's or Christie's,"" she added. Pawnbrokers fall under the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act, but auction houses do not. ""Why should the rules be stricter for a mom-and-pop business hawking stereos in Milwaukee than a billion-dollar auction house in Manhattan?""

Concerns overblown?

But some dealers claim that reports of black-market transactions and money laundering are overblown. One dealer, Randall A. Hixenbaugh, president of a nonprofit organization called the American Council for the Preservation of Cultural Property, has called statistics on the illicit trade unfounded and argued against the new regulations.

""Virtually all transactions of high-dollar amounts in the ancient art business are handled through financial institutions and instruments already covered by the Bank Secrecy Act,"" Hixenbaugh said. ""Criminals seeking to launder ill-gotten funds could hardly pick a worse commodity than antiquities.""

Legislative staffers who helped craft the new regulations said that they were guided by what they learned in Congressional hearings and from industry experts. UNESCO warned earlier this year that the development of online sales platforms and social networks had facilitated the illicit sale of antiquities and that existing regulations had failed to stem the black market.

The new legislation calls for a study on the role of art in money laundering and terror financing. (A recent Senate report has already outlined how at least two Russian oligarchs had exploited the opaqueness of the art world to bypass U.S. sanctions.) If the study finds a link between the art market and illicit activity, it could, upon congressional review, trigger the creation of rules similar to the ones now concerning the antiquities trade. Regulators have also signaled that the Bank Secrecy Act could be further extended into the art market.",6369919069,https://gulfnews.com/business/banking/us-poised-to-apply-banking-regulations-to-antiquities-market-1.1609566035470,,,

46,:Article,news,Want to Buy Some Stolen Antiquities? Try Facebook.,669258636,2020-12-09T18:11:00Z,0.011764706,"Somewhere in Yemen, a thief's left hand grips a severed bronze head, rotating it for appraisal. His right hand holds a camera, which he uses to focus on the details of the figure. In spite of the poor lighting and shaky camerawork, the statue's features are clear: coiled hair, crooked nose, hollow eyes. Once he's uploaded the video to Facebook, it has plenty of company. Since at least 2014, when ISIS expanded its revenue streams to include the plunder of archeological sites in Syria and Iraq, Facebook has become a clearinghouse for looters and purveyors of stolen cultural artifacts.

You might think a black market for antiquities would exist out of sight, a system of whispers and shadows requiring code words for entry. The reality is banal -- disturbingly so. Accessing the black market for antiquities is no more difficult than requesting membership in the popular ""Dogspotting"" Facebook group. Facebook's ""Groups"" feature lets users connect efficiently and (sort of) discretely to share the locations of loot like Egyptian coffins. According to the Antiquities Trafficking and Heritage Anthropology Research (ATHAR) Project -- the only group of its kind monitoring social media -- Facebook is the wellspring of the modern illicit antiquities trade, where traffickers thrive because of the platform's laissez-faire regulation.

In June, after half a decade of persistent activism from archaeologists and terrorism experts and a U.N. Security Council report that cited Facebook as ""a tool for the illicit trafficking of cultural property,"" the social network updated its community standards -- the official guidelines about which posts should get removed -- to include a ban on selling, trading, and soliciting ""historical artifacts."" Headlines praised Facebook for its ""anti-looting crackdown,"" and for taking a stance. This is a familiar refrain. Multiple times over the past decade, with begrudging acknowledgment, Facebook has nominally banned a number of illegal trades through its community guidelines.

Alas, news of these crackdowns must never have reached traffickers, who continue to deal in human remains, illegal drugs, and endangered wildlife on the platform. Since the policy change, ATHAR has noted the continued growth of active Facebook trafficking groups -- from 120 in June to more than 130 by November.

These groups total more than 2 million members (though some may be part of more than one group), and they serve a dual function. Primarily, they are ""traditional"" black marketplaces, where prospective buyers can post requests alongside posts of looters detailing their finds. Community members express initial interest through comments, often speculating on the origin, age, and value of the pictured objects. Most, however, are browsers. Genuine shoppers complete the actual transaction behind the encrypted walls of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

In addition, the groups function as a training ground for a new generation of looters. Experienced members -- including those connected to violent extremist groups -- share techniques, provide excavation tutorials, and offer pricing guidelines as a way to help amateurs expand the market. Meanwhile, the administrators of these groups -- who often collect cuts from money exchanged in transactions -- are highly connected individuals, with influence extending into the legitimate antiquities market in the West. Artifacts looted by ISIS-affiliated thieves in Syria, may, thanks to Facebook, end up in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.

War is a primary facilitator of illegal trafficking on Facebook and beyond. Within the 95 Middle Eastern Facebook Groups analyzed by the ATHAR project in 2019, 36 percent of posts selling artifacts came from conflict zones and 44 percent came from countries bordering those zones. This is no coincidence. There has been ample documentation on the use of antiquities trafficking to fund operations of extremist organizations such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and Hurras Al-Din. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict -- adopted as a result of Nazi looting in World War II -- has long since made the ""theft, pillage, or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property"" illegal as a matter of international law. It is also, predictably, a federal crime in the United States to engage in black market dealings.

So how has Facebook evaded accountability?

The 1996 Communications Decency Act Section 230 -- drafted long before the advent of social media -- protects internet platforms from liability for the actions of third-party posters. Facebook remains shielded even though the black market heavily depends on the platform's predictive algorithms to lead buyers to new trafficking groups -- not to mention the unambiguous illegality of the black marketeers' activities. Also, because Facebook is a U.S. company, foreign governments lack the authority to moderate Facebook content. Nations hit hard by looting have to go through the U.S. State Department to petition for memorandums of understanding to limit imports to the U.S. of historical artifacts. But with the broad reach of social media, the success of such import restrictions is limited. Syria, one of only 17 countries with such an agreement, now sees historical artifacts being sold into Turkey before coming to the U.S. under false pretenses, despite FBI warnings.

Unlike traditional cloak-and-dagger networks, however, the black market on Facebook is easily accessible to anyone who searches for it -- including monitors and regulators. If just a handful of experts at ATHAR are capable of monitoring more than 2 million members of antiquities trafficking groups, there is no reason to believe Facebook's claims about the intractability of regulating the problem itself. Facebook has the means to, at the very least, keep track of and limit the most egregious trafficking. By failing to act, Facebook facilitates the destruction of cultural heritage and enables terrorism. (Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.)

Policing the sale of severed heads of sculptures would pose no threat to Facebook's bottom line. Fighting the destruction of world heritage would not hurt the company's ad revenue. Facebook has every incentive to repair its increasingly tarnished reputation, made worse daily by its aiding and abetting of violence and viral falsehoods.

Change to Facebook's regulatory practices requires public outrage over the destruction of cultural property, over the abuse of vulnerable communities that have had their heritage held hostage and sold for component parts.

But this isn't an intractable problem. ATHAR has already proved that a cost-efficient approach to curbing trafficking crime on Facebook exists. Facebook only needs to hire a handful of archeological experts to identify, document, and report black market activities -- a drop in the bucket for a multibillion-dollar company.

Until then, the private collectors and institutions who receive decapitated Yemeni statues should thank their benefactor with a placard: ""Looted courtesy of Facebook.""",6336334685,https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/facebook-stolen-antiquities-art-black-market.html,,,

50,:Article,news,"After outcry from antiquities trade, Unesco further adjusts ad campaign on looted artefacts ",780368344,2020-12-08T12:00:00Z,-0.176470588,"Dealers association challenged the campaign's claims that two newly pictured objects were stolen A blurb in a Unesco ad campaign against illicit trafficking in antiquities stated that a statuette was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo in 2014. That wording was later revised. Unesco

An advertising campaign by Unesco that calls attention to illegal art trafficking has undergone further revision after accusations that it misrepresented the background of the objects pictured in the ads.

The campaign, titled ""The real price of art"" and conceived with the Paris ad agency DDB, depicts art objects in elegant Western interiors with captions indicating that they were looted from their countries of origin. Last month, Unesco hastily pulled back three images of objects that had been culled from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection -- a Buddha's head, a funerary monument and a mask -- after the Met complained and others pointed out that the works were not looted in recent years as the ads claimed and in fact had a much longer provenance.

Those high-resolution images, all in the public domain, were evidently harvested from the Met's website, although the advertising text did not identify the Met as the owner of the objects. Also pulled from the ad campaign was an image of Pre-Columbian vessel from Peru that was apparently a stock image from the photo agency Alamy.

In swapping out the images last month and publicly expressing its ""regrets"" to the Met, the UN agency retained just one work of art of the five it originally used in the campaign: a 15th-century panel from the Ghent Altarpiece that was verifiably stolen in 1934 in Belgium.

It immediately added two others: a statuette of a Sumerian Woman With Polos, or headdress, dating from 2650-2350BC (it was originally mistakenly labeled 2659-2350AD) that Unesco said was looted in 2014 from the National Museum of Aleppo in Syria, and a tribal mask dating from the early 20th century that it said was stolen in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast ""when fighting broke out following the crisis of 2010.""

Lazare Eloundou, the director of culture and emergencies at Unesco, told The Art Newspaper then: ""To avoid any misunderstanding on the purpose of the campaign, the campaign is now exclusively composed of items that have been looted.""

The problem was that neither of the added objects was looted: both still reside in museums in their country of origin, as the International Association of Dealers in Ancient Art (IADAA) pointed out last week in its monthly newsletter. ""Unesco may well regret the embarrassment, but it doesn't seem to have learned from it as the two hastily inserted replacement photos for the campaign testify,"" wrote Ivan Macquisten, an industry consultant who is also an occasional contributor to The Art Newspaper.

The Aleppo statuette, which in reality is small, is reproduced in the ad at several times its size atop a bookcase next to a fuzzy armchair in a well-appointed living room.

The National Museum of Aleppo and the Syrian government's directorate-general of antiquities and museums in Damascus, which oversees the institution, did not respond to requests for information on the whereabouts of the statue. Several scholars contacted by The Art Newspaper confirmed that the statuette remains in the museum, however, including Zainab Bahrani, a professor of ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology at Columbia University.

The statuette can also be glimpsed in a video about the reopening of the Aleppo museum last year. A separate video prepared by the Syrian tourism authority, the IADAA newsletter notes, quotes Khaled Al-Masri, director of Aleppo museums and antiquities, as stating that despite an attack on the museum with mortars and missiles a few years earlier, the collection inside was totally preserved rather than looted.

After the IADAA newsletter went out, Unesco changed the text of the ad depicting the Woman With Polos. Under the headline ""Supporting an armed conflict has never been so decorative,"" it had read: ""This priceless antiquity was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo when the fighting was at its peak in 2014, before being smuggled into the European market."" Now the underlying blurb says: ""A priceless antiquity similar to this was stolen from Syria, when the fighting was at its peak in 2014, before being smuggled into the European market.""

A blurb in a Unesco advertisement after being changed to eliminate the contention that a statuette was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo Unesco

Asked where this similar antiquity had resided before its reported theft, a Unesco spokeswoman said in an email, ""If you think there was no looting in Syria of objects similar to the Woman in Polos, we leave it to you to state this in your article."" No further explanation was given.

Unesco has said that the ad campaign underlines the severity of the threat from illegal trafficking in art and artefacts and has been acclaimed by member states. ""All images and texts used in the current campaign have been carefully chosen and drafted in cooperation with all the institutions concerned,"" says a statement from the culture and heritage sectors of the agency relayed by the Unesco spokeswoman.

The director of the Musée des Civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire in Abidjan, Silvie Memel-Kassi, confirmed by email that the mask described in the campaign as having been looted from her museum is still in the collection. A similar mask by the same sculptor was stolen from the museum during an armed conflict in 2011, however, along with other objects from the institution, she adds.

A blurb in a Unesco ad says the mask depicted was looted after a crisis in 2010 in Abidjan. The director of the Musée des Civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire in Abidjan says it remains in the museum's collection, however. Unesco

Memel-Kassi emphasises that she authorised the use of the photo, which she says was originally shot in 2016 and distributed to advance an awareness campaign about stolen objects. That image also accompanied a recent article she wrote about illicit trafficking of Ivorian collections for The Journal of Art Market Studies.

""The National Museum of Côte d'Ivoire is a partner of Unesco, and therefore supports the campaign of this organization which, in my humble opinion, responds to the aspirations of member states,"" she says in an email. ""The image we have given enters into this concept of illicit traffic. This is why we did not hesitate for a single moment.""

Memel-Kassi adds: ""The antique dealers who protest against the use of this image certainly have their reason which I ignore.""

Unesco also confirmed that Memel-Kassi ""gave us her full permission to use the image of the mask, and agreed to the text accompanying the image"".

But representatives of the antiquities trade counter that the blurb accompanying the image of the mask is deceptive. They note that the text, under the headline ""How do you erase a whole culture? Piece by piece,"" reads: ""This African art object was looted in Abidjan when fighting broke out following the crisis of 2010.""

Since the IADAA sent out its newsletter, another work of art has been added to the ad campaign: an Inca ceramic jug from Peru dating from 1470-1532 that Unesco says was looted in an illegal excavation at an unspecified date. The object is certain to be scrutinised by those associated with the antiquities trade.

""Several things indicate how poorly Unesco have handled this updated campaign,"" Macquisten said in an email. ""They still list the tribal mask as looted, when it was not. The Woman With Polos is depicted roughly at a scale of around three times its actual size,"" and ""the original caption was made up, as our evidence showed and as their alteration to it now shows."" He adds that the campaign was supervised by at least five Unesco officials named in the online version of the ad campaign, ""none of whom acknowledges any real wrongdoing even now"".

The antiquities trade has long been at loggerheads with Unesco, of course, accusing the agency of overstating the dimensions of illicit trafficking in antiquities, including Unesco's current $10bn global estimate, and undermining what dealers claim are legitimate sales.

Last month, Cinoa, the international federation of art and antiquities dealers associations, protested the inclusion of images of objects in the Met's collection. ""The campaign is fraudulent, with the desired intention to mislead the public on the provenance of works of art and to damage the credible reputation of the art trade and collectors,"" Cinoa's president, Clinton R. Howell, wrote then in a letter to the director general of Unesco, Audrey Azoulay.

Erika Bochereau, secretary general of Cinoa, says in an email that her group has been working with Unesco to ""suggest effective and focused legislation that enables the legitimate trade to flourish"". She adds, ""We however, cannot accept the insinuation of Unesco's latest campaign that the art trade operates in an untrustworthy way with criminal groups.""

The campaign, which opened on 20 October, is timed to the 50th anniversary of the 1970 Unesco convention against illicit trafficking in cultural property, which the UN agency marked in November.",6334176230,http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/unesco-further-adjusts-ad-campaign-on-looted-artefacts-after-outcry-from-antiquities-trade,,,

52,:Article,news,"From Kohinoor to Goddess Annapoorna, why some stolen objects return and others don't",267313943,2020-12-03T06:09:00Z,-0.003921569,"The records of the Archaeological Survey of India show that the government has been able to retrieve 40 art objects between 2014 and 2020. However, demands for the return of objects like the Kohinoor and the Amravati marbles have been turned down.

An 18th century idol of Goddess Annapoorna, stolen from India about a century back, will soon be making its way back to the country from Canada. The statue, holding a bowl of kheer in hand, had once adorned a temple on the riverbanks of Varanasi, and was stolen by lawyer Norman McKenzie sometime in the early 20th century. Since then, it has been part of the McKenzie art gallery collection at the University of Regina, Canada. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the idol would be repatriated by the Canadian government. In a statement, University of Regina's Vice-Chancellor Thomas Chase said the act of repatriation will help ""overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible"".

""One of the very first Indian words to enter the English language was the Hindustani slang for plunder: loot,"" writes historian William Dalrymple in his most recent work, 'The anarchy: The relentless rise of the East India Company'. The word which had originated in the plains of northern India, entered British vocabulary by the 18th century. Incidentally, that was also the time when hundreds of artefacts, paintings, coins, manuscripts and much else were shipped across to England by colonial officers.

Dalrymple goes on to describe the colossal amount of loot made by the first governor of the Bengal presidency Robert Clive kept in the Powis Castle in Wales. ""There are more Mughal artefacts stacked in this private house in the Welsh countryside than are on display in any one place in India... The riches include hookahs of varnish gold inlaid empurpled ebony, superbly inscribed Badakhshan spinels and jeweled daggers; gleaming rubies the colour of pigeon's blood, and scatterings of lizard-green emeralds,"" he writes.

But colonial loot was systematic and made to look lawful. With the Independence of the country, similar plunder continued, but now it became an act of crime. Names like Subhash Kapoor, Vijay Nanda, Deenadayalan continue to be investigated in connection with millions of dollars worth of smuggled cultural heritage. ""The primary difference is in the sense of ownership. In the pre-independence period when the colonisers were doing it, there was a rhetoric of victory. It wasn't really looting as much as a sense of entitlement,"" says Samayita Banerjee, research scholar in History at Ashoka University, who has been doing extensive research on heritage conservation. ""Post Independence it becomes a matter of theft as there exist laws to protect antiquities.""

Over the years, thousands of artefacts of cultural importance to India have found themselves in museums and exhibitions abroad. ""UNESCO has estimated that more than 50,000 art objects were smuggled out of India over the decade 1979-1989 alone,"" writes international law expert Jeanette Greenfield in her book, 'The return of international treasures'. In recent years, repatriation of stolen art objects have gained currency. The records of the Archaeological Survey of India show that the government has been able to retrieve 40 art objects between 2014 and 2020, and 75-80 art objects are in the pipeline to be returned. Yet while some return, others continue to remain in faraway lands, carrying within them an uneasy history of plunder and pillage.

""The major interpretative strategy by which India was to become known to Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries was through a construction of a history of India,"" writes anthropologist Bernard S. Cohn in his celebrated work, 'Colonialism and its forms of knowledge.' He notes that it was the British in the 19th century, who in an authoritative way defined what is valuable among objects found in India. ""It was the patrons who created a system of classification and determined what was valuable, that which would be preserved as monuments of the past, that which was collected and placed in museums, that which could be bought and sold, that which would be taken from India as mementos and souvenirs of their own relationship to India and Indians,"" he writes.

Perhaps the most significant among objects that made its way to the British Museum through this process of exploration and classification of Indian history is a Buddhist shrine, the Amravati Stupa which was established in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh in the 3rd century BCE. It came into public attention in the late 18th century, when Colin Mackenzie excavated and recorded it. By 1845, Sir Walter Elliot removed parts of the sculpture and kept them in the Madras Museum, from where they were transferred to London in 1859, under the assumption that it would get spoiled in India. At present, it occupies a separate gallery in the British Museum, and unlike the Kohinoor, there is hardly any political rhetoric around its retrieval.

Mackenzie had been employed by the governor-general of India, Lord Wellesley, to conduct a survey of artefacts, oral histories and religion in South India. By the end of his career, objects collected by him included 6,218 coins, 106 images, 40 antiquities, 1,568 manuscripts, as well as copies of inscriptions and copper plates from temples. In the 1820s, after the death of Mackenzie, orientalist H H Wilson dispatched his entire collection to London. Some of these were put on display at the small museum which the Company had at its headquarters in Leadenhall Street.

The British Museum contains a large volume of Indian artefacts, a majority of which are from the collection of Major General Charles Stuart. Stuart lived in India between 1777 till his death in 1828. Nicknamed 'Hindoo Stuart', he was known for his fascination with Indian sculpture, primarily from Bihar, Bengal, Orissa, and central India. His collection was bought by John Bridge at an auction in London in 1829-30. The British Museum acquired the collection from his heirs in 1872.

By the end of the 18th century, a number of EIC officials had returned back to England and were actively trying to maintain the repository of Indian cultural heritage they had acquired in India. A result of this was the collection of the India Office Records in the British Library. In 1801, it purchased its first huge collection of miniature paintings from retired company servant Richard Johnson. Similar collections of paintings of Hindu deities and other religious relics were also donated or sold by other company officials like John Flaming and Francis Buchanan Hamilton.

Some of the most famous among such objects which are still in England include a white nephrite jade wine cup belonging to Shah Jahan currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the seventh-century Sultanganj Buddha which is in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Then there were the war booties from India. The most famous among these of course is the Kohinoor which the British took under its possession after winning the second Anglo-Sikh war in 1849. Currently, it is on public display in the Tower of London and continues to attract political attention regarding its repatriation. But there are other such objects as well like Maharaja Ranjit Singh's throne, decorated with rich gold sheets, also acquired during the Anglo-Sikh war. Currently, it is kept in the Victorian and Albert Museum in London. Then there is Tipu's Tiger, an 18th-century mechanical toy that was carried away by the British when they stormed Tipu's capital in 1799. It was later transferred to the Victorian and Albert Museum in London.

Towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, there emerged an idea of retaining and conserving India's past. ""There emerged a growing consciousness to preserve the archaeological heritage of India. Curzon alongside John Marshall who was the director-general of the ASI were avid proponents of conservation,"" explains Banerjee. Thereafter the effort to conserve the archaeological and cultural heritage of the country continued well into the period after Independence. In 1904, the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act was passed, which was followed by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958.

However, the exit of colonial powers ushered in a new phase of heritage theft. Archaeologist Vinay Kumar Gupta, in a research paper 'Retrieval of Indian antiquities: Issues and challenges', writes that the ""lawful and organised looting of colonial powers changed into unlawful and disorganised looting"" which was possible due to the ""lack of strong anti-smuggling laws in former colonies."" He writes: ""In India, the easiest target of smugglers have been the abandoned ancient temples, religious mathas, or platforms on the outskirts of villages and archaeological mounds which are illegally dug out from time to time.""

For instance, in 1976, a labourer digging up a field at Panthur village of Thanjavur district found a bronze idol of Lord Nataraja. He sold it off to a Canadian collector who in turn sent it to a curator at the British Museum. In 1991, however, the Nataraja was returned to Tamil Nadu.

Another remarkable case of heritage smuggling was that of the eight idols including the bronze Nataraja at the Brihadeshwara temple in a small village named Sripuranthan in Tamil Nadu. In 2006, they were stolen and smuggled out by the US-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor. In 2008 it was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia. After the theft was exposed, the Australian government returned the Nataraja idol along with another idol of Shiva to India in March 2014.

There are many other pieces of antiquities, however, that continue to remain abroad. ""From Khajuraho alone over 100 erotic sculptures had been stolen from the period between 1965 and1970,"" write Banerjee and research scholar Ishani Ghorai in an article for the online portal Sahapedia titled, 'Antiquities theft and ilicit antiquities trade in India.' They note two other famous cases of theft, one being the sensational case of burglary in the Jaipur palace museum when 2,492 medieval period paintings went missing, and the other was the 1968 theft at the National Museum in New Delhi when 125 pieces of antique jewellery and 32 rare gold coins were stolen.

Speaking about the loopholes that allow such blatant plunder of cultural heritage even today, Banerjee says, ""when I do my fieldwork what comes across to me is the lack of education about heritage."" She adds, ""Say a person residing at a remote village in Bengal, he would probably not know why he needs to keep a 2nd century CE bronze sculpture. Also, there is very little monetary compensation for him, if at all. That is exactly what these networks of theft exploit.""

In recent times though, there has been a conscious attempt by the ASI to detect smuggled objects and by museums abroad to return stolen artefacts. In September this year, the UK returned three ancient idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita stolen from Tamil Nadu in 1978. In 2018, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York announced its decision to return an eighth-century stone sculpture of Goddess Durga and a limestone sculpture dating to the third century CE. More recently, the Australian government decided to return two 15th century door guardians from Tamil Nadu and a sculpture of a serpent king from either Madhya Pradesh or Rajasthan.

At the same time, however, demands for the return of objects like the Kohinoor and the Amravati marbles have been turned down. In 2013, when British prime minister David Camaron was on a visit to India he was asked about the repatriation of the Kohinoor to which he replied that he did not support 'returnism' since it would empty out British museums.

Speaking about why it is more difficult for those objects which were shipped out during the colonial era to be returned, former director of antiquities in the ASI, DM Dimri says, ""at that time India was part of the British empire. So an object removed from here and sent to London, was a mere shifting of location. Therefore they cannot be considered an illegal export.""

""When it comes to objects that were taken 100 or 200 years back by colonial powers, it is not clear whether we can call it stolen or not. Once it is clear that an object is stolen in the modern sense of the term, it becomes easier to return it,"" says Vinod Daniel who is Chair, AusHeritage and board member of International Council of Museums (ICOM). ""But a lot depends on the repatriation policy of the institution or country concerned. For instance, the Australian Museum has a clear policy that anything with social or religious significance that has been brought from another country will be returned if there is a request,"" he adds.

In the last few years, growing public demand has emerged for the return of stolen objects. In 2014, two Singapore-based Indian art enthusiasts, S. Vijay Kumar and Anuraag Saxena, started the India Pride Project which uses social media to identify Indian cultural artefacts abroad and initiate their return. The group was active in ensuring that the Sripuranthan Nataraja was returned to India.

""History belongs to its geography,"" says Saxena about the objective behind the project. ""We are glad that through our initiative we have been able to bring this issue to public consciousness. Another impact I think we have had is to have a political consensus around this matter,"" says Saxena.

Speaking about what more needs to be done to ensure that cultural heritage of the country is preserved, Saxena says, ""there needs to be a national register or repository of all our heritage."" ""Secondly, India needs to have a special task force that deals with this problem,"" he adds. ""Unless India claims what is rightfully ours, we cannot claim our place in the world.""

The SOHR pointed out that the arrested officer was using cars that traveled with Turkish military convoys to smuggle antiquities, noting that the Turkish forces tightened surveillance on Turkish and Syrian forces after the incident.

According to the opposition sources of the SOHR, there is a group of Turkish officers in Idlib working in the Syrian antiquities trade and transporting them from the Arab Republic to unknown destinations.

They reported that the region is witnessing increasing illegal excavations, with the facilities of Turkish officers in the disposal of archaeological finds.

The Observatory said that the jihadists of Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) have been working for a long time, excavating antiquities on public or private lands, after their owners were forced to agree, and selling antiquities through smuggling to Turkey.",6320986986,https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/turkish-forces-arrest-officer-responsible-for-smuggling-antiquities-out-of-syria/,,,

Antiquities trafficking has been a source of funding, akin to drug and weapons trafficking, for everything from ISIS and other terrorist groups to the Italian mafia and Latin American drug cartels. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)The EU law, which was first passed in 2019, requires strict licensing and registry for the import of art, books, artifacts and other cultural goods older than 250 years which originated outside of the Union.

Those in the art world who felt the law would place a significant burden on dealers, heavily lobbied against it, the Art Newspaper reported. They argued that the requirements, especially the requirement to identify the source country couldn't fully be applied to artifacts with complex histories. They also argued that antique books, art and artifacts, are significantly different realms and can't reasonably be regulated under the same law.

""As much as 20% of printing in 15th-century Venice was done for England. The books were printed in Italy, then maybe bound in France, illuminated in Belgium then sold to England -- what's the so-called 'source country' then?"" Sibylle Wieduwilt, an antique book dealer in Germany, told the Art Newspaper before the law was ratified.

She added that archaeological artefacts and books are ""two completely different things and should not be treated in the same way.""

However, it was an attempt by the EU to clamp down on the trade which has ballooned to a multi-billion dollar industry and has been known to be a source of funding, akin to drug and weapons trafficking, for everything from ISIS and other terrorist groups to the Italian mafia and Latin American drug cartels.

According to the law, it was designed to ensure ""the preservation of humanity's cultural heritage and the prevention of terrorist financing and money laundering through the sale of pillaged cultural goods to buyers in the Union.""

The looting of cultural property from active war zones is considered a war crime under the 1954 Hague Convention.

However, Daniel Dalton, a former member of the European Parliament from the U.K. told Art Newspaper last month that once Brexit is finalized, the country would not be continuing to uphold the law.

While a license is still required for the export of the U.K.'s own cultural goods, under the U.K.'s new laws, no such barrier exists for the import of those from other countries.

However, the EU law will still apply to those who want to show off their goods or collections at international exhibitions within the Union.",6388907106,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13629-after-brexit-the-uk-is-open-to-almost-unrestrained-antiquities-trade,,,

89,:Article,news,Regulating the Art Market Is Good Foreign Policy,369775367,2021-01-14T14:34:00Z,-0.019607843,"On January 1, the U.S. Congress passed its annual defense bill over the veto of President Donald Trump. The $741 billion National Defense Authorization Act funded the Pentagon, greenlighted pay raises for U.S. troops, and allocated resources to counter China and bolster cybersecurity. Tucked alongside these provisions was one that addressed a lower-profile concern: illicit activity in the antiquities trade.

The $28.3 billion U.S. art market has long evaded regulation. A culture of secrecy, together with rules that allow buyers and sellers to remain anonymous, has allowed criminals to exploit the art market to launder money, evade taxes, and finance terrorism. In July 2020, for example, a Senate report revealed that Russian oligarchs had skirted U.S. sanctions in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea by buying more than $18 million in art through shell companies and an intermediary. When the major auction houses ran their due diligence, they investigated the intermediary but never asked whom he was buying for.

For the better part of the past century, the federal government capitulated to the wishes of a powerful coalition of museums and art collectors who lobbied against efforts to regulate the industry. But over the past two decades, in response to high-profile accounts of looting in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the discovery that the Islamic State (or ISIS) was using the sale of stolen antiquities to bankroll its operations, lawmakers have started to see an unfettered art market as a threat to national security, and they have acted accordingly.

The new law brings some welcome accountability to this realm: it subjects the trade in ancient artifacts to the transparency requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, a 1970 law that requires designated entities to help federal authorities detect and prevent financial crimes. Antiquities dealers fought the measure, but it passed with wide bipartisan support.

The defense bill marks a real advance in the decades-long evolution of Washington's approach to the art market. But its transparency requirements are only a first step. Congress and the State Department need to make it easier for the United States to assist countries whose patrimony is at risk -- and not only when national security is clearly implicated. Protecting cultural property cuts off a major source of funding for terrorists and other transnational criminal organizations, but it is also smart diplomacy, a way to signal respect for a country's heritage and build lasting goodwill. For a new administration looking to repair relationships around the globe, cultural protections are a win-win.

Since at least 1970, when the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted a landmark convention to protect cultural property, the United States has been reluctant to combat antiquities theft. The convention asked states to stop importing stolen cultural property and to help return looted items to their countries of origin. Although the United States participated in drafting the treaty -- exerting its influence primarily to water down the text -- it was not among the first group of countries to sign on. When the Senate eventually gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the convention in 1972, it added a reservation requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation before the treaty could take effect domestically.

Congress tried and failed to pass such legislation for the next decade. The State Department argued that the United States should help countries protect their cultural property ""on grounds of principle, good foreign relations, and concern for the preservation of the cultural heritage of mankind."" But that plea was no match for art dealers and their congressional allies, who maintained that regulating the art market would put the country at a competitive disadvantage relative to art-importing nations that had not yet signed the treaty. Coin collectors, who worried about aggressive customs enforcement, formed another vigorous lobby against the bill.

For a new administration looking to repair relationships around the globe, cultural protections are a win-win.

The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act finally passed Congress in 1983, implementing the UNESCO treaty into U.S. law. It provided a long-sought framework for the United States to help countries protect their cultural heritage, allowing the president to sign bilateral agreements with requesting states to restrict imports of looted antiquities. But the law did not make it easy for states to ask for help. States wishing to secure U.S. assistance had to submit formal requests in writing, documenting their own efforts to protect their patrimony. Bilateral agreements then had to go through a lengthy bureaucratic approval process, and no agreement could last longer than five years without being extended.

Put simply, although the law was an important step forward, tackling the theft of stolen antiquities remained an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy. For policymakers, the issue lacked urgency -- it took another 12 years for Washington to negotiate its first bilateral agreement (with El Salvador, in 1995), and even now, the United States has fewer than two dozen such agreements in force.

Events in the early 2000s began drawing public attention to the issue of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban shocked the world by destroying the Bamiyan Buddhas, sixth-century statues carved out of sandstone cliffs in central Afghanistan. But what really galvanized Congress was the looting of the National Museum of Iraq in 2003. More than 15,000 artifacts were stolen from the museum during the mass looting that accompanied the arrival of American troops in Baghdad. Although a U.S. Army unit tried to investigate a report of looting at the museum, retreating under heavy fire, the media blamed American troops for standing by. Under pressure to act, Congress authorized the president to impose import restrictions on Iraqi antiquities without having to wait for a formal request from the Iraqi government.

More than a decade later, stolen antiquities would resurface as a U.S. national security issue with regard to ISIS. In 2015, U.S. Special Forces raided the compound of ISIS leader Abu Sayyaf, near Deir ez-Zor, Syria, and found receipts indicating that the group had made more than $1.25 million from looting and selling antiquities. In fact, ISIS ran a department of antiquities through which it sold permits to looters wishing to raid archaeological sites and then took a cut of any sale. To lawmakers, the national security implications of protecting cultural property had become clear. In 2016, by unanimous consent, the Senate passed the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act, directing the president to impose import restrictions on cultural property from Syria.

Over the years that followed, lawmakers worked to close loopholes that make the art market attractive to money launderers. Art dealers dispute the prevalence of illicit deals in their market, but the Treasury Department considers the buying and selling of art to be a ""well understood method of illicit financial transactions."" In December 2019, for example, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a Beirut diamond dealer with close connections to Hezbollah who had been using an art gallery and extensive private art collection to shelter and launder money. The July 2020 Senate report, which detailed how Russian oligarchs had taken advantage of the U.S. art market, confirmed the industry's vulnerability. Congress could no longer afford not to act.

The new rules specifically extend the Bank Secrecy Act to those ""engaged in the trade of antiquities,"" but their application affords the United States an opportunity to regulate the art market more broadly. The European Union and the United Kingdom already subject high-value art transactions to regulations against money laundering, and there is no reason the United States -- which accounts for 44 percent of the global art market -- shouldn't do the same.

Likewise, the United States should seize the occasion to bulk up its protection of cultural property. Congress could amend the 1983 act to include a blanket ban on importing stolen cultural patrimony; it could model this law on ones already on the books in the European Union. Doing so would build goodwill with countries whose patrimony is at risk -- they would no longer have to request U.S. assistance to receive it -- and send a clear signal to illicit buyers and sellers.

The United States should seize the occasion to bulk up its protection of cultural property.

Even short of a blanket ban, Congress and the State Department could help clear the roadblocks that prevent states from asking for help. The State Department should encourage diplomats to publicize and advocate for bilateral agreements in high-risk countries, and Congress might consider loosening some of the application requirements -- especially for countries that lack the detailed records to prove that they have taken reasonable steps to protect their cultural property on their own. To streamline the process, the advisory committee that processes the applications, which currently meets three times a year, could meet more frequently.

Laws protecting cultural property will ultimately be only as good as their enforcement, and a dedicated effort is needed in this area, as well. The Manhattan district attorney's office furnishes one promising model: its Antiquities Trafficking Unit has seized more than $175 million worth of antiquities since 2012. At the federal level, the Department of Justice could establish an office for investigating cultural property crimes, including money laundering, antiquities trafficking, and fraud. The most successful prosecutions will have to be global in nature, involving coordinated investigations across multiple countries, and they will need to be sensitive to new developments, such as the proliferation of online sales platforms and social networks, that allow the black market to flourish.

A broad effort to clean up the art market may make it costlier to do business in the art world in the short term. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Tighter regulation will make the art market less vulnerable to those who would exploit it for criminal purposes. And by strengthening cultural property protections, the new administration can not only weaken terrorists and other criminal organizations but also contribute to rebuilding U.S. friendships abroad.",6388520691,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-01-14/regulating-art-market-good-foreign-policy,,,

The stolen artifacts were hidden in storage rooms in private homes.

The artifacts aren't just from sites in ancient Israel; they come from across the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Africa and even South America. So far, investigators haven't even quantified everything they've recovered.

""We haven't counted them yet,"" Amir Ganor, head of the theft prevention unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, told Haaretz.

The raids at three sites in Israel came after a months-long investigation into the illegal antiquities trade, according to Haaretz. The stolen artifacts were hidden in storage rooms in private homes. The Israeli antiques market is prone to being infiltrated by blackmarket items; according to Ganor, it is one of the few countries around the Mediterranean where dealers can obtain a license to sell antiquities. Unscrupulous thieves and dealers can thus launder stolen artifacts through licensed dealerships, effectively erasing their illegal origins. From there, the stolen items can enter the international antiquities market.

Some of the stolen artifacts were museum-quality, according to the IAA.

""It's a gargantuan find -- hundreds of coins, pottery from a lot of periods, statues and bronze items, stone items, and glass as well,"" Ganor told Haaretz.

Many of the local artifacts were coins from the Seleucid Empire, which ruled what is modern-day Israel from 312 B.C. to 63 B.C.. There were also stone statuettes, red-and-black pottery from Greece and Italy, Roman-era oil lamps, jewelry, Egyptian sarcophagus lids and painted wooden boxes, and a striking green glass vessel decorated with faces. Also found, but not confiscated, were hundreds of carved wooden masks from Africa. Investigators didn't take these masks because they weren't sure whether they were ancient or newer, Ganor said. The focus of the theft prevention unit is items made before A.D. 1700, he said.

Much of the pottery found had actually been cleaned and pieced together. It's not clear whether the original looters who took the artifacts from burial sites restored the pottery or whether underground restorers did the work. Three suspects were arrested, according to Haaretz, with more arrests expected. However, the suspects were dealers, not the original thieves. Investigators are now working to determine the precise origins of the stolen goods.

104,:Article,news,How will US money laundering crackdown actually impact the art market? A lawyer explains,174052535,2021-01-06T16:10:00Z,0.02745098,"Congress is increasing its regulation of antiquities trade and while its powers are limited for now, change will come so the art industry must prepare The new regulations will bring greater scrutiny of dealers in antiquities in the US Photo by Stijn te Strake

On 1 January, the US Senate overrode President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 (NDAA), a bill that (perhaps surprisingly) included rules affecting the art market. Specifically, the new law subjects antiquities dealers to the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, requires registration of the ultimate beneficial ownership of limited liability companies, and directs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the Department of the Treasury to conduct a study of money laundering in the art market. Long considered but only now passed, the bill is a significant step into regulating the US art and antiquities market, though still far less invasive than the European Union's current approach. The new regulations raise questions about the cost benefit balance of compliance, but leave no doubt after last year's Senate report that regulators have the art market in their sights and the market must respond if it wants to have a say in the oversight that is sure to come.

Whatever one thinks of the regulations or the regulators, these things are happening. And while it is questionable whether FinCEN is the right body to conduct a study of the art market, the market has a choice here. We can complain, or we can get involved in the dialogue. I would rather be at the table in the discussion than outside the room. The FinCEN study may not be ideal, but it is an opportunity that responsible actors will ignore at their peril.

The new law

The law amends the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 5312(a) to extend to ""dealers in antiquities."" That phrase is not defined, and thus begs the question of who a dealer in antiquities is (and who is not). It does include ""advisors"" to such persons, so it is more expansive than it may first appear. These antiquities dealers are to file what are called ""suspicious activity"" reports, to ensure that potential clients are not among those being sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), and to report any cash transactions over $10,000.

The law also takes aim at another tool often used to thwart transparency: limited liability companies (LLCs). The role of LLCs is often in the eye of the beholder. Like any capital structure, LLCs are overwhelmingly used for legitimate purposes. Corporations and individuals form LLCs to hold assets, to run discrete lines of business, and to separate unrelated activities. In the United States LLCs are creatures of state law and must be formed in compliance with the rules of the respective Secretaries of State. The person who charters the company is publicly visible but is usually an agent of the company (like a law firm). Who the actual shareholders are is not usually public knowledge. Indeed that is often the point.

there is no question that if you are out to obfuscate, multiple layers of capital structures are an effective way to do so.

This is all perfectly ordinary, and one way I often attach red flags to analysis is the use of ""shell company"" as a pejorative per se. But in fairness, there is no question that if you are out to obfuscate, multiple layers of capital structures are an effective way to do so.

The law will now require the filing of beneficial ownership information with FinCEN. That information would still not be publicly visible on demand, but it would be more easily accessed by law enforcement or other legal proceedings.

Most broadly, the law contains what amounts to handwriting on the wall about what comes next. The bill directs FinCEN to ""perform a study of the facilitation of money laundering and the financing of terrorism through the trade in works of art."" To that end, FinCEN is required to submit a report within a year to Congress addressing, among other things, the extent of money laundering and terrorism financing in the art trade, the need for further regulation, and similar themes.

What comes next

This is where the rubber will hit the road, and there is reason for concern. Last summer's Senate report was rhetorically sweeping, but was actually about one case of two businessmen already on the OFAC sanctions list. The Senate investigators spoke in detail to multiple auction houses and still came away with mostly recycled clichés, but perhaps some degree of removal from specific investigative targets will illustrate the point better. Can we expect better of FinCEN? Not unless those actually involved in the trade speak up. There are too many readily-accessible story lines for regulators to resist, whether it's the same rehashed article about freeports or, as above, complaining about ""shell companies."" And speaking up can have an effect, witness the recent pushback on UNESCO's use of unsourced numbers about the market value of illicit artifacts trade.

The feeling here is that the effect on transparency of the Bank Secrecy extension will be smaller than the cost because the UBO information will be no more knowable to counterparties than it was before. The best approach remains vigilance to a variety of information, including UBO but also the history and risk factors of the object and the counterparty. Accusing the art market of being rife with crime and money laundering is a familiar trope, but the perception is relevant and has clearly influenced policy that will affect the day to day. Whatever an ""antiquities dealer"" is, most are not major auction houses and the sustainability of compliance services or personnel in a year that has crushed the small and medium sized businesses could be severe.

As noted, however, the key point is that the issue is on the policymakers' radar, and across the political spectrum. Change is coming. The question is: what will it be?

107,:Article,news,Lawmakers Are Cracking Down on the 'Unregulated' US Art Market. Here's How a New Anti-Money Laundering Law Will Affect Dealers,791952186,2021-01-06T13:32:00Z,0.11372549,"The new regulations target antiquities dealers, but could soon apply across the art market.

The US antiquities trade is going to face far stricter oversight in 2021 than it has in the past.

On January 1, the Senate overrode President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021, a bill that includes a new law requiring antiquities dealers to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. That means dealers will now have to adopt anti-money laundering programs designed to root out illegal practices.

One of those requirements involves identifying and registering the so-called ""ultimate beneficial owner"" -- or the true owner of a limited liability company. Now, savvy collectors and investors who rely on offshore entities and shell companies to conceal their true identities when executing art trades, particularly high-value ones, will have a harder time doing so.

The US treasury department is expected to draft regulations on the specific policies that antiquities dealers must implement. Congress has already given the department guidance on which topics to address, including suggesting that the regulations vary by the size of the business, the size of the transaction, the location of the transaction -- and whether the dealer must identify the purchaser when he or she is working through an agent or intermediary.

The new regulations could also extend beyond the antiquities market. This year, the treasury department is expected to complete a study on whether there is evidence of money laundering in the broader art market. The Senate banking committee will then use the findings to determine whether the same anti-money laundering provisions applied to antiquities dealers should apply to all art dealers.

According to one art law attorney, the outcome of that study is ""a foregone conclusion: an alliance of government regulators, class-conscious legislators, and art market critics will seize upon the opportunity to convince the Biden cabinet to regulate the art business,"" says Michael McCullough of the New York firm Pearlstein and McCullough.

Observers in the auction and gallery art markets have been closely following the bill, which comes on the heels of related legal measures taken in the UK.

A representative for Christie's said the auction house ""welcomes the opportunity to work with US regulators on appropriate and enforceable anti-money laundering guidelines.""

The Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), meanwhile, has been in talks with congressional committees about the bill with the hopes of balancing the burden on those in the trade.

""The ADAA has sought to ensure that any new regulation is adequately supported by data about the scale and scope of any identified problems,"" the organization said in a statement. Its legal and public policy advisors have been working with lawmakers to ""generally introduce them to, and educate them about, the vibrant small businesses that make up the community of art dealers in the United States.""

The most difficult aspect of creating workable anti-money laundering policy, McCullough says, ""is finding the right balance between complying with law and continuing to honor a client's need for discretion and privacy.""

Anti-money laundering programs typically cost thousands of dollars per year to implement, as well as significant time and effort, according to Washington, DC-based attorney Peter Tompa, who represents organizations that lobby for museums and dealers. ""The costs to small and micro business are substantial,"" he says. ""Furthermore, it is impossible to 'fly under the radar screen' of such requirements; such regulations are enforced by the banks which will close accounts that do not comply.""

Many in the industry say they've been expecting stricter legal scrutiny for a while. Last year, a subcommittee in the US Senate issued a strongly worded report on the international art market, calling it the ""largest legal unregulated market in the United States."" That analysis left ""no doubt,"" according to attorney Nicholas O'Donnell, ""that regulators have the art market in their sights and the market must respond if it wants to have a say in the oversight that is sure to come.""",6376012595,https://news.artnet.com/art-world/what-will-stricter-us-oversight-of-the-antiquities-trade-look-like-1935081,,,

Thousands of ancient, spectacular and rare items, hundreds and thousands of years old, from both Israel and around the world, were seized on Monday in a major operation; items that were allegedly robbed from cemeteries throughout the Mediterranean basin, as well as from Africa and South America.

The IAA, Police and the Tax Authority have been tracking a number of suspects in Israel in recent months.

Evidence was gathered against the suspects, who were arrested when the authorities raided three centers in the Gush Dan area. The suspects were detained for further questioning.

Amir Ganor, director of the IAA's Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery (UPAR), stated that ""this is one of the most significant operations carried out in Israel against illegal trade in antiquities.""

The IAA inspectors were amazed to discover thousands of items worthy of display in museums, including many rare finds dating from the 1st millennium BCE through the 11 century CE.

The artifacts included hundreds of ancient coins, some of which are very rare, precious stones inlaid with jewelry, pieces of statues, figurines and heads of gods from the Roman period, dozens of rare painted pottery of the type ""black figures and red figures"" from the 5 century BCE, worship vessels, parts of statues and more.

Some of the items were looted from tombs, sealed in antiquity. The objects left in the tombs were left as offerings to the dead, and according to the belief, were to accompany the dead to the next world.

The IAA is tracking down the source of the items and is investigating whether they were robbed from an antiquities site in Israel or from the Mediterranean Basin.

The Interpol and other international enforcement bodies are also involved in the investigation.

""This is the beginning of the investigation,"" Ganor clarified.

""Antiquities are a heritage asset belonging to all cultures and humanity and cannot be treated as if they were vegetables or other consumer products that have a substitute,"" he added.

According to Ganor, ""an archeological find that is detached from its archaeological context by antiquities robbers and sold for the greed of money, in fact created a black hole in history, and we are working to prevent this in every way.""

In countries where artifacts are looted, their illegal trade is often a significant funding source for both organized crime and militant groups. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)The more than 4,500 pages-long bill authorized a US$740 billion defense budget, but was packaged with several riders and amendments. President Donald Trump initially vetoed the bill, but his veto was overridden by a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and the House.

One division of the bill was devoted to anti-money laundering measures, including such efforts in the antiquities and arts trade.

As a cash-heavy industry with too often little oversight, both the legal and illegal antiquities markets have long been considered ripe for money laundering purposes.

While there are money laundering risks even in the trade of legitimately acquired artifacts, the art world has found itself embroiled in money laundering and organized crime through the trade and sale of looted cultural property bearing false provenance records.

For the buyers, false provenance records can boost the value of an item whose sale can then be used to underwrite illegal deals or whose donation can be used for a bloated tax write-off.

In countries where artifacts are looted, their illegal trade is often a significant funding source for both organized crime and militant groups.

""You cannot look at it separately from combating trafficking in drugs and weapons. We know that the same groups are engaged, because it generates big money,"" said Catherine de Bolle, Executive Director of Europol after a major crackdown on the trade back in May.

According to a 2018 report by Standards Charter Bank, the illegal antiquities trade is a multibillion dollar industry which ""not only robs us of our past and cultural heritage, but recent cases have evidenced that looting and trafficking of art and antiquities funds criminal activities and creates conflict and extremism around the world, producing long-lasting economic damage.""

The looting of cultural property from active war zones is also considered a war crime under the 1954 Hague convention.

Though the specific provisions will be decided on by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), according to The New York Times, the bill will broaden the 1970 bank secrecy act and require dealers to provide greater transparency in deals over a certain dollar amount.

That's something industry leaders fought strongly against, and in the last two years alone the auction house Christies spent over US$100,000 to influence the bill, according to the Times.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" Tess Davis, the executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, told the Times.",6374058399,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13577-new-us-bill-tackles-money-laundering-in-the-antiquities-trade,,,

One of the little-acknowledged features of the National Defense Authorization Act, finally passed over the president*'s veto at the end of last week, is the fact that, within that massive bill, Congress took serious action to sharpen the country's regulations regarding money laundering -- which, come to think of it, may have been yet another reason why the president* vetoed the thing. From ThomsonReuters:

The stated purpose of the AML Act includes improving coordination and information sharing among those U.S. agencies tasked with administering AML requirements, federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies, national security agencies, the intelligence community, and financial institutions. It also seeks to modernize the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. AML law, and other related laws to help the government and private sector better respond to new and emerging threats, and ensure efforts to combat financial crime are based more clearly on risk.

Additionally, it would require companies to report their beneficial ownership to the U.S. Treasury Department at the time of incorporation, providing law enforcement a registry to query during investigations, thereby raising the corporate veil that has traditionally allowed criminals to hide behind shell companies.

Another provision applies the anti-laundering statute to a marketplace that heretofore has been pretty much the Wild West -- namely, the worldwide trade in art and antiquities, which apparently has evolved into one of the busiest coin-ops in the world. From the New York Times:

Watchdogs have urged Congress to tighten regulations on the antiquities trade for years. The looting of cultural heritage sites in countries like Syria and Iraq has resulted in a growing black market for Middle Eastern antiquities. Law enforcement abroad has seized hundreds of artifacts, which officials believe trace back to earlier excavations carried out by terrorist groups like ISIS.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" said Tess Davis, the executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, a nonprofit organization that monitors the illicit trade of artifacts.

""A pawnshop's business model does not differ greatly from that of a Sotheby's or Christie's,"" she added. Yet pawnbrokers fall under the purview of Bank Secrecy Act, but auction houses do not. ""Why should the rules be stricter for a mom-and-pop business hawking stereos in Milwaukee than a billion-dollar auction house in Manhattan?

The trade in ancient objets d'art always has involved more than a little piracy. If it didn't, we wouldn't have had the British Museum all these years. And there also is the memorable episode involving the Green family and their Museum of the Bible, in which the Good Christian Folk of the Hobby Lobby fortune allegedly went into business with smugglers.

The new legislation calls for a study on the role of art in money laundering and terror financing. (A recent Senate report has already outlined how at least two Russian oligarchs had exploited the opaqueness of the art world to bypass U.S. sanctions.) If the study finds a link between the art market and illicit activity, it could, upon congressional review, trigger the creation of rules similar to the ones now concerning the antiquities trade. Regulators have also signaled that the Bank Secrecy Act could be further extended into the art market.

Excavations carried out in 2020 uncovered all sorts of exciting surprises, despite the challenges of the health crisis, which required stringent safety measures and resulted in fewer hands in the field, especially archaeology students and volunteers from abroad.

Epidaurus

One of the most exciting pieces of archaeological news in 2020 came from excavations around the tholos building at the Sanctuary of Asclepius in Epidaurus in the eastern Peloponnese, which began roughly a year ago with the discovery of an Archaic structure by the team of Vassilis Lambrinoudakis, professor emeritus of classical archaeology.

New finds made in the area point to the existence of a chthonic residence of the god dating back to his earliest presence at Epidaurus. They also indicate that Asclepius' presence in the area dates back much further than believed. The unidentified building - which had a ground floor and basement with a mosaic floor and colonnade - was built in the same area as the emblematic 4th century BC tholos building.

Despotiko

The tiny, 8-kilometer island off the southwestern coast of Antiparos in the Cyclades continued to offer important treasures in 2020, as did the adjacent rock of Tsimintiri, which was connected to Despotiko in ancient times. Apart from the discovery of a 10 structures, archaeologists working at the two sites focused their efforts on the restoration of an Archaic temple dedicated to Apollo.

Work was also carried out for improving accessibility with the construction of wheelchair ramps at Despotiko, while more restorations have been planned for 2021.

Rineia

Much of the year on Rineia - the mysterious and cloistered site that has been in the shadow of sacred Delos for so long - has been dedicated to the important task of mapping the island's geomorphology and identifying the exact locations of its artifacts.

According to the director of the Cyclades Ephorate of Antiquities, Dimitris Athanasoulis, this is the first effort ever made to fully document the site and create a framework for its archaeological profile. The work has uncovered ancient farmhouses, an unknown road and the traces of a large altar, while also yielding shards of bird sculptures and sections of steles.

Zominthos

A small part of a gold sheet uncovered by a rainstorm on Crete compelled archaeologist Efi Sapouna-Sakellaraki to raise a stone layer of an altar found at the palace complex of the Athens Archaeological Society's excavations at Zominthos, around 7 kilometers west of Anogeia. This led to the discovery of a burned tree trunk, lined with 90 gold sheets, and small plates, which must have been attached to the altar or scattered around it.

According to the archaeologist, findings indicate that area in the northern foothills of Mount Ida (Psiloritis) was once ""inhabited by the descendants of the Knossos dynasty"" and was ""an important economic, religious and cultural center."" The two-, perhaps even three-story, main building was in use from at least 2000 BC.

Kydonia

Archaeologists working on the palace complex of Kydonia in Hania, Crete, uncovered the deepest part of a trench used for sacrifices that tallies with the earlier discovery of the remains of animal offerings and those of a young girl dating to Mycenaean times, in the 13th century BC.

The trench is also believed to be responsible for the collapse of the sacrificial altar, as fragments of flooring were found inside it. Archaeologist Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki, meanwhile, told Kathimerini that even though the complex was likely destroyed by a massive earthquake just before the mid-13th century BC, digs in 2020 indicated that it was built before the mid-14th century BC.

Athens

The discovery in downtown Athens, at number 25 Aeolou Street, across the road from the Church of Agia Irini in Psyrri, of the head of an ancient statue depicting the god Hermes was one of the most surprising findings of the year. It was exciting news mainly because the discovery was made during work on the sewerage system by the municipal authority, under the supervision of the City of Athens Ephorate of Antiquities. The head is believed to date to the late 4th or early 3rd century BC and is impressive for the good state it was found in.

Underwater museum

The year 2020 saw the inauguration of Greece's first underwater museum, near the uninhabited islet of Peristera off the eastern coast of Alonissos in the northwestern Aegean.

The launch of the museum allows amateur archaeologists and divers to explore the area on guided tours carried out by certified centers on Alonissos. The highlight of the tour is a 425 BC shipwreck that contained around 4,000 wine vessels.

Repatriations

Greece scored an important victory in 2020 with the return of an 8th century BC bronze equestrian statue that was due to go under the hammer at Sotheby's. The Greek side had filed an official request with the auction house so that the artifact could be returned to Greece and while Sotheby's withdrew the item from auction, it also took legal action against the Greek state in a court in New York in June.

The Greek Culture Ministry, however, persisted with its claim of ownership of the artifact, and was vindicated with what Minister Lina Mendoni described as a ""massive international success in the fight against the illegal antiquities trade."" The reason is that the American court's ruling in favor of Greece is an important precedent for any country seeking the return of historical items that have been looted and are being put up for sale.

Greece also saw the return of five rare silver coins dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BC that were returned before being auctioned off in Munich and Zurich. The three from Munich are a stater from Lindos (Rhodes) from the first half of the 5th century BC, an octadrachm of Getas, the king of Edonians in Thrace, dated to around 480-460 BC, and a stater from Elis, dated to around 328 BC. The other two, from Zurich, are an Athenian tetradrachm dated to 136 BC, and a tetradrachm of Ptolemy IV Philopator cut in Sidon around the end of the 3rd century BC.",6373011840,https://www.ekathimerini.com/260787/gallery/ekathimerini/life/for-archaeologists-at-least-2020-was-a-good-year,,,

The Syrian geography has experienced remarkable shifts of power and influence and military, political and economic changes, with no actor or military power in Syria could care less about lives of the people of Syria. Since January 1, 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has documented the deaths of 6,817 people, including 1528 civilians of whom there are 231 children and 197 women. This is the lowest yearly death toll ever since the start of the ""Syrian Revolution"".

In 2020, the Syria scene went through various developments reflected at all levels, including the political, economic and social . The most prominent developments in Syria in 2020 could be summarized in the following:

Ongoing arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances and kidnappings

With the prevalence of kidnap gangs, armed militias and groups, arrests and forced disappearances of men, women and children continued throughout Syria, no matter which power dominates which area. In 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitored and tracked kidnappings across Syria and managed to document 512 incidents of kidnapping, including 61 children and 53 women. Most of these kidnapped civilians are still detained, and a few others were released after having paid ransoms, while 43 civilians, including two children and five women, had already been killed by their kidnappers. It is worth noting that regime-controlled areas have topped the list of kidnappings in 2020, with 198 incidents, followed by areas under the control of Turkish forces and their proxy factions with 183 incidents, then SDF-held areas with more than 92 incidents. While the smallest number of incidents of kidnapping has been recorded in areas under the control of rebel and jihadi factions with 39 incidents. Also, SOHR documented the deaths of 119 Syrian civilians under torture in regime prisons.

Syrian women: extra burdens and deprivation of rights

The ongoing violence and hostilities in Syria in 2020 had touched the lives of Syrian women, as the recent dire conditions have affected women psychologically and socially. The Syrian Observatory has been continuously focusing on the sufferings of Syrian women, which can be summarised in the following main points:

Moreover, Syria's war has created a very bitter reality and left negative psychological impacts on Syrian women, as the absence of social security, struggle with unstable conditions, torture, detention and violence made Syrian women vulnerable to psychological trauma, including permanent fear, anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies and withdrawal, especially with the lack of psychological and mental health treatment, and limited medical capabilities and resources.

As the Syrian crisis, with its ongoing violent and bloody fighting, mass displacement and crippling social and economic consequences, the children of Syria have emerged as its biggest losers; and they are the real and true victims of this tragic conflict, for they are the ones who live a bitter present and potentially face an uncertain and bleak future.

In 2020, SOHR highlighted the unabating suffering and plight of the children of Syria, chief among them were:

Economic, social and political consequences of the deteriorating security and mounting human rights violations

Violations committed by all warring powers in Syria in 2020 have scarred the Syrian society on all levels, including the economic, social and political and can be summarized in the following main points:

Continuous corruption

The most prominent corruption files in 2020 was that of Rami Makhlouf, Bashar Al-Assad's tycoon cousin. Makhlouf was a key pillar of Al-Assad regime's economy, the financial executive arm of the regime, the regime's partner in looting the Syrian people's money and public funds, and one of the most important backers financing Al-Assasd's war effort since 2011. The rift between Rami Makhlouf on one hand, and the Syrian regime and the Russians on the other, started after the regime and Russians seized ""Al-Bostan Association"" in 2019 and dissolved all affiliated militias under the pretext of ""corruption"". At that time, the regime confiscated the funds of Rami Makhlouf and his mobile phone company ""Syriatel"", arrested officers, regime soldiers, managers, employees, technicians and fighters working for businesses and associations belonging to Rami Makhlouf, asked Makhlouf to pay funds owed to the ""Syrian Telecommunications Regulatory Authority"", and froze his assets under ""precautionary seizure"".

Rami Makhlouf has been accused of tax evasion and illicit enrichment during the Syrian war which started in 2011. Makhlouf, however, accused the security services of arresting employees working for his business in order to force him to give up and resign from his companies, particularly ""Syriatel"" company which controls nearly 70% of Syria's telecommunication market.

Most of employees in Makhlouf's companies, arrested by regime security services, were released later in September 2020, including 41 employees in ""Syriatel"" and 57 others in ""Al-Bostan Association"". Furthermore, 58 regime officers and soldiers who dealt and cooperated with Rami Makhlouf affiliated militias were also released.

Moreover, the entire Syrian geography, no matter which power dominates, struggled with poor surveillance and wide prevalent of corruption due to the extreme poverty, sanctions and Syrian currency plunge, which helped stockpiling, monopoly and black markets to ""flourish"". In the wake of sever crises in Syria in 2020, corruption noticeably escalated and prevailed even among top officials, as SOHR disclosed, in January 2020, several acts of corruption by officials of the ""Salvation Government"" via the ""Ministry of Development and Humanitarian Affairs"" which struck deals with humanitarian and aid organizations operating under its banner, seizing all support provided for these organizations and aid supplies allocated for displaced people, which later were sent to HTS fighters.

As for SDF-held areas, reliable sources informed SOHR on April 17 that fighters and commanders of ""Manbij Military Council"" were involved in smuggling operations between areas held by ""Euphrates Shield"" factions, and areas under the control of ""Manbij Military Council"", where the smuggled goods were sold for much higher prices. It is worth noting that the crossings of Tal Tamr, which have been prepared for such smuggling operations, are under supervision of Jaysh Al-Thwaar, Sh'aytat and SDF.

While in November 2020, reliable SOHR sources confirmed that officials in Al-Hawl camp and some members of the Internal Security Forces (Asayish) received bribes reached $4,000 each in return for helping 110 extremist ISIS women to move from their section inside Al-Hawl campin Al-Hasakah countryside, to other sections allocated for Syrian and Iraqis refugees. These officials also allowed the camp's inhabitants to bring in large sums of money over $200 which is officially allowed by the camp's administration

Recruitment operations and the transformation of Syrian fighters into mercenaries

In light of the sever economy hardship in Syria, some regional states have exploited and recruited many Syrians, turning them into mercenaries to guard and serve their own interests outside Syria. Russia, for example, has recruited nearly 3,000 Syrian fighters, via ""Wagner Security Group"" to fight in Libya onthe side of the ""Libyan National Army"", at the same time when Turkey has recruited 18,000 Syrian fighters, including 350 children under the age of 18, sending them also to Libya to fight alongside the ""Government of National Accord"". Additionally, Turkey has recruited 2,580 Syrian mercenaries thrown into battles in Azerbaijan. Not to mention the child recruitment operations by the SDF-backed ""Al-Shabiba Al-Thawriyah"" (Jawani Shourshokr) which kidnap children, forcing them to join its affiliated military groups.

Increasing forced mass displacement...shoddy and unfit refugee camps...""farcical"" Russian and regime-sponsored conference on refugees' return...regime efforts to profit from the plight of refugees stranded on Lebanon-Syria border

The fierce and violent battles among all warring parties in conflict zones in Syria led to the destruction of vital infrastructure almost completely, forcing more than half of Syria's population to displace to other areas in and outside Syria, as the Syrian civil war has been descried as the ""worst man-made disaster since World War II"". In this context, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented enforced displacement movements during the war, shedding light further on Al-Hawl camp which has become the largest refugee camp in Syria with nearly 70,000 displaced people and refugees living in it, mostly of whom fled from areas which had under the control of ISIS.

Another refugee camp on the Iraq-Syria-Jordan border triangle, Al-Rukban camp, is struggling with dire economic, social and medical situations, posing a threat to the lives of 11,000 displaced people living there. It is worth noting that Idlib and surrounding countryside experienced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people over the military operations by regime forces and the Russians. Meanwhile, displaced people in Harbanoush camp in northern Idlib, Talmannas camp in the west of Kafriya village in the north-eastern countryside of Idlib, and other makeshift camps in Deir Hassan village near the Syria border with the Iskenderun region in northern Idlib are suffering from similar disastrous humanitarian situation.

On February 16, the Syrian Observatory confirmed that the number of displaced people in Idlib and Aleppo exceeded two million, following the expansion of contested and fought over areas. The Russian and regime forces' latest military escalation in Idlib and Aleppo since mid-December 2019 led to the largest displacement wave ever, amid dire humanitarian situation in the wake of lack of minimum levels of basic livelihood and overpopulation in areas of displacement. While on July 14 SOHR activists monitored a new wave of displacement in Ariha city and other villages in Jabal Al-Zawiyah, as civilians were fleeing from the ongoing Russian airstrikes and intensive bombardment by regime ground forces, with tens of rockets and artillery shells hitting the areas. Idlib is one of the most overpopulated Syrian provinces with large numbers of displaced people and refugee camps, which drains the province's own economic resources and leads to the spread of various negative social phenomena, including the high ratio of poverty, unemployment, crimes and violence.

Furthermore, Syria has experienced several incidents of enforced displacement which aimed at changing the demographic structure of specific regions. One example, among many, is Turkey's demographic change in Afrin canton. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has monitored and tracked such changes in Syria which started in ""Al-Kedam"" neighbourhood in Damascus on March 13, 2018, and were followed by several displacement operations in accordance with deals and agreements between factions and representatives of the areas which experienced mass exodus on one hand, and Russian and regime forces on the other. The Syrian Observatory documented an estimated 120,000 displaced people who left their areas in eastern Ghouta, southern Damascus, southern Rif Dimashq, eastern Qalamoun, north Homs countryside and south Hama countryside, and headed to northern Syria region. Most of these displaced people moved to Afrin canton, and in turn, hundreds of thousands of Afrin inhabitants were forced to displace due to ""Peace Spring"" operation. After the Turkish-led operation, tens of thousands of displaced people were settled in the houses and farms that belonged to Afrin's indigenous Kurdish civilians who were forced to flee the violations and atrocities of Turkish forces and their proxy factions.

As for Syrian refugees, the Syrian regime exploited the plight of refugees stuck on the Syria-Lebanon border since March 23, 2020, the date of the closure of the Syria-Lebanon border crossings, when hundreds of Syrians living in Lebanon wanted to return to Syria after they had lost their income, along with the start of the coronavirus outbreaks. The Syrian regime's authorities issued ""Resolution No. 46"" on July 8, 2020 preventing Syrian citizens from entering Syria, unless a sum of 100 USD was handed over and exchanged, on arrival, into Syrian pound at an official rate set by the Syrian Central Bank. Such obstinate decisions and procedures by regime authorities led to the death of a Syrian girl on the Syria-Lebanon border.

On the other hand, Russia and Syrian regime allied nations insisted on holding an international conference on refugees' return in November. It is worth noting that the European Union member states, which host the bulk of Syrian refugees, as well as the United States boycotted the conference, while a United Nations representative attended as an observer. Meanwhile, the conference failed to find a workable solution for the refugees' hardship, especially with the ongoing killing, displacement and demographic change throughout Syria, let alone the major donors' shrinking funds allocated for Syria's post-war reconstruction, which would cost around $400 billion according to initial reports.

Increasing suicide cases

In light of the disastrous living conditions of most of Syrian people, SOHR has recorded 51 confirmed cases of suicide in Syria since the beginning of 2020, including 13 cases of children under the age of eighteen and eight cases of women, with Aleppo province topping the list of the number of suicides. Violence and protracted conflicted have greatly contributed to the increasing the number of people whose dire conditions forced them to kill themselves.

Aid suspension

Many factors have led to blocking and suspending aid supplies provided to many IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camp, which threatens Syria with unprecedented famine. Some prominent reasons behind depriving Syrian people from aid allocations can be summarised in the following:

And as a part of the ""politicization"" of humanitarian aid delivery into Syria, vital aid supplies have been blocked as the United Nations Security Council failed to extend permission for humanitarian aid to be delivered via crossings on the Turkey border, because of the Russian-Chinese veto. Moscow has insisted on reducing the number of border crossings to one, Bab Al-Hawa crossing in Idlib, arguing that 85 % of humanitarian aid supplies pass through this border crossing. Russia also wanted to shut down the other border crossing, Bab Al-Salama crossing in Azaz in northern Aleppo.

Poor healthcare

The protracted conflict in Syria has left serious unforeseen consequences regarding the medical sector, including the following:

It is worth noting that most of Syria's resources goes into armament, while 70% of health and medical services and hospitals have been put out of services due to the military operations.

SOHR had cited the World Health Organization's warning and concern considering the rapid outbreak of the novel coronavirus, especially in refugee camps. The Syrian Observatory has tracked the development of coronavirus pandemic, documenting the confirmed infections and deaths across Syria, which were regionally distributed in late 2020 as follows:

Deteriorating education and Ideological curricula

Education is a sector which has had the largest share of damage and destruction due to bombardment and displacement, with a large number of those displaced being children, where children are either dropping out or stay in education but facing obstacles hindering their education. The deteriorating education in Syria could be attributed to many factors, including the destruction of infrastructure, low funds, lack of teachers, fragile curricula, and high rate of illiteracy. One example, among many, of deterioration of education is the ""politicized and ideological"" curricula provided by the Autonomous Administration in their controlled areas. Accordingly, some residents refuse to send their children to schools in these areas. Besides, military powers control some schools and educational centres in Autonomous Administration's held areas. Moreover, the certificates are not recognized in areas outside the control of the Autonomous Administration, which means that such certificates will be useless if their holders decided to move to another area inside Syria or another country.

Repression and violations against media activists

The Syrian Observatory has monitored and tracked repression and violations against journalists, media practitioners and activists whose job is to document violations committed by the various warring parties against the Syrian people. Such violations included prosecution of Syrian, Arab and foreign journalists, threats of killing, arrests, enforced disappearances and killing. From March 15, 2011 to November 16, 2020, SOHR activists documented the death of 748 Syrian journalists. Furthermore, 100 journalists were killed by ISIS and opposition rebel, Islamic and jihadi factions, and here is a quick breakdown:

Also, 38 journalists have been abducted and forcibly disappeared in areas under the control of opposition factions and Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham. SOHR has also documented a blatant violation against journalists by Turkish forces, when two journalists within a convoy in Ras Al-Ain city were killed during the Turkish-backed military operation ""Peace Spring"".

In regime-held areas, however, SOHR activists say that Al-Assad's regime has been clamping down on and arresting Syrian as well as foreign journalists who criticize the regime, oppose its policy or go into issues of corruption. Regime forces and their proxy militias have killed 541 Syrian journalists and eight foreign journalists. Among the total number of journalists killed by the Syrian regime there were seven females as well as five SOHR activists killed in Latakia, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Damascus and Rif Dimashq; while 56 other journalists died under torture in regime prisons. Additionally, Russian aircraft have killed 29 Syrian journalists.

On the other hand, SDF-held areas have also witnessed violations against journalists and media activists. SOHR sources have confirmed the deaths of six activists killed by SDF members, while five journalists had disappeared in SDF-held areas and their fate remained known. While the International Coalition aircraft killed three Syrian journalists, including a journalist who was working as an activist at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Raqqa city.

SDF-held areas: Signing oil deals with U.S. amid regime condemnation...unprecedented escalation in Ain Issa at the end of the year

SDF's new deals with the United States concerning the petroleum sector in eastern Euphrates region led to the signing of an agreement between Syria Democratic Forces and ""Delta Crescent Energy"", seemingly an ad-hoc American oil company, in late July 2020. The new agreement stipulates maintaining, developing and modernizing oil fields in SDF-held areas, in addition to providing two mobile refineries which are planned to process nearly 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

In an effort by Washington to control Syria's oil, as most of oil fields are located in Deir Ezzor and Al-Hasakah provinces in north and east Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian regime has rejected these deals, while Russia, Turkey and Iran criticised them, with the refusal of the people of Deir ez-Zor, which comprises an Arab majority.

In this context, the Syrian Observatory monitored security tensions in Deir ez-Zor which resulted in human losses, especially of oil workers, in addition to attacks on tribal elders in Deir ez-Zor, where the Syrian Observatory documented a number of assassinations attempts on tribal elders and sheikhs in the area.

The Syrian Observatory also documented several assassinations targeting tribal elders and dignitaries in Deir Ezzor.

On July 31, 2020, ISIS claimed responsibility for the killing of ""Ali Suleiman Al-Hamadah"", the official spokesperson for ""Al-Ekaydat tribe"", in Al-Busayrah town in eastern Deir Ezzor. It is worth noting that ""Al-Ekaydat"" is a large Arab tribe which dominates the Near Euphrates region with some 500,000 members and affiliates.

On August 1, gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying dignitaries of ""Ekaydat"" tribe, including ""Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Hafal"" and ""Sheikh Matshar Al-Hafal"", the uncle of the head of ""Ekaydat"" tribe and one of the owners of the land where Al-Omar oil field is located. The attack, which took place in Theban town in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, resulted in the death of ""Sheikh Matshar Al-Hafal"" and the car's driver, while ""Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Hafal"" sustained serious injuries.

Another attack targeted ""Ali Al-Salman Al-Bakari"" the head of Al-Dahla village in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, he is also a senior dignitary of ""Al-Bakarah"" tribe, one of the largest Arab tribes in the region.

In this context, the ""Ekaydat"" tribe held SDF responsible for the series of assassinations against tribal elders and dignitaries, as SDF did not adopt the needed measures or procedures in order to control the security situation and put an end to the assassinations in areas under their control.

Moreover, SOHR activists monitored IN MONTH growing popular anger as well as the escalating protests and demonstrations in the wake of these repeated assassinations in the towns of Al-Shuhayl, Dheban and Al-Hawayej.

On the other hand, SDF-held had occasionally been subjected to military operations and attacks by Turkish forces and their proxy factions, disrupting stability in the region, increasing unrest, depleting more resources and fuelling public discontent. The strategic town of Ain Issa has been witnessing an unprecedented Turkish military escalation since November 10 to this date, through shelling and attacks in an attempt to cut off the Hasakeh-Aleppo road.

On December 24, 2020, SOHR activists documented a significant rise in the death toll of Turkish-backed factions due to Ain Issa's ambush in Al-Raqqah governorate in the SDF-held area. Where SDF set up an ambush in the village of Ma'alaq near Ain Issa, planting landmines. Meanwhile, the factions carried out an infiltration attempt as SDF withdraw from the village. The ambush killed 31 fighters of the factions.

Despite counter attacks by Coalition forces and their Syria Democratic Forces partner, in addition to security campaigns by Russian and regime forces against ISIS cells, ISIS continues launching attacks on regime forces and SDF in areas under their control.

ISIS cells continue their escalating activities in various areas in the Syrian desert, targeting regime forces and loyal militias through ambushes, explosions and surprise attacks, inflecting human and material losses on regime forces.

This resurgence happened despites the considerable support by Russian and regime jets through airstrikes on ISIS position.

The escalating military operations were concentrated in Aleppo-Hama-Al-Raqqah triangle, in addition to the deserts of Homs and Deir Ezzor.

These areas were witnessing daily military operations, as Russians and regime forces are trying to put an end to ISIS escalating activities.

According to SOHR statistics, ISIS managed to kill 819 regime soldiers and loyal militiamen in 2020, including 108 Iranian-backed non-Syrian militiamen, in ambushes, attacks, shelling and clashes in the Syrian desert. Also, ISIS lost 507 fighters in clashes and airstrikes by Russian and regime fighter jets in the same period.

Meanwhile, ISIS cells in SDF-held areas were numerous and widely active, moving in the region ""comfortably"" despite the security campaigns by SDF and the International Coalition.

SOHR activists documented more than 480 operations by ISIS cells in SDF-controlled areas in Deir Ezzor, Al-Hasakah, Al-Raqqah and Manbij in 2020. These operations, including detonations, ambushes and attacks, claimed the lives of 208 persons: 86 civilians, including 10 children and six women, and 122 SDF fighters.

In 2020, the Syrian Observatory monitored the participation of the International Coalition in tens of SDF security campaigns through raids and airdrops in eastern Euphrates region, mostly in Deir Ezzor. During these operations, 113 persons were arrested for ""belonging to ISIS"", including several ISIS commanders. Also, SDF and International Coalition Forces killed eight ISIS cells' members, including former commanders. Moreover, SOHR sources have confirmed that tens of people had been arrested by SDF and International Coalition under the pretext of tracking down the group.

However, these security campaigns failed to end ISIS cells' activities. The Syrian Observatory also monitored many ISIS operations, including killings, assassinations, bombings and attacks, as well as asking civilians to pay zakat by sending messages on WhatsApp and threatening them.

As for ISIS's abductees, all sides remain quiet and provide no clarification on the fate of thousands of abductees, where fear continues to grow for the lives and fate of the abductees, including Father Paolo Daololio, Bishops John Ibrahim and Paul Yazji, Abdullah Al Khalil, a British journalist, sky news journalist and other journalists, in addition to hundreds of abductees from Ain Al Arab (Kobane) area and Afrin, as well as the people of Deir ez-Zor. The Syrian Observatory has called on the leaders of the International Coalition and SDF to make the outcome of investigations with the group's prisoners public.

Turkey's role in Syria: Escalating violations in Afrin, hidden ties to ISIS-linked military brigades and withdrawals from regime-held areas

During2020, Turkey continued to push deeper into Syrian territories.

On 25 February 2020, SOHR monitored Turkey's land-grab attempts to expand its border further into Afrin and annex more Syrian territories in order to achieve several goals, the most prominent of which was expanding its borders on the outskirts of Balya village of Bulbala town to a distance exceeding 315 meters.

On June 7, 2020, very reliable sources provided the Syrian Observatory with detailed information about a battalion which consists of nearly 40 Iraqi fighters, operates under the banner of ""Ahrar Al-Sharqiyyah"" faction, and works for the Turkish intelligence..

According to SOHR sources, the battalion works in northern Syria with a task of carrying out assassinations, executions and detonations.

Moreover, the Iraqi battalion used to bury people it killed in a mass grave on the outskirts of Susanbat village on the road between Al-Bab and Al-Ra'i in the north-eastern countryside of Aleppo. SOHR has obtained information about the fact that this battalion had killed nearly 300 civilians, combatants and ISIS members buried in the battalion's mass grave in Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory highlighted all Turkish withdrawals from observation posts in areas annexed recently by regime forces, as out of 12 main Turkish posts in north-western Syria region, Turkish forces completely evacuated the following five posts:

While there were four other main Turkish posts out of regime-controlled areas, and they are as follows:

As for the recently-established Turkish posts, SOHR activists reported that Turkish forces completely withdrew from the following four posts: Maar Hattat and Al-Sena'a in the east of Saraqeb in rural Idlib, Al-Kurani factory in Al-Zarbah, and Qubaytan Al-Jabal in Aleppo countryside. Furthermore, Turkish forces continued dismantling equipment in Al-Duwayr post in northern Saraqeb in preparations to evacuate it.

It is worth noting that Turkish forces are still stationed in several posts established recently in regime-controlled areas, including the grain warehouse in the south of Saraqeb, Al-Sayromat factory in northern Saraqeb, Tarnabeh in western Saraqeb, and another post in Aleppo countryside near Kafr Halab.

Turkish-backed areas:Seizure of civilians' land and properties, imposition of levies and theft of antiquities and worship places

Violations against residents in the ""Peace Spring"" and ""Olive Branch"" areas continued to mountin 2020.

Since taking control of the area in October 2019, the Turkish-backed factions have been committing violations, stealing and looting civilians' property, including the seizure of land and farms and the stealing agricultural equipment. They also prevented farmers from cultivating their land in villages on the frontlines separating Turkish-backed factions and SDF-held, villages such as Al-Mahmoudiyyah, Aniq Al-Hawa, Al-Qasimiyyah and Al-Rayhaniyyah, near Tal Tamr area in the northern countryside of Al-Hasakah.

Moreover, ""Al-Hamzaat Division"" had seized agricultural land owned by more than 100 families with an area of 30 hectare in Ras al-Ain countryside in the areas of ""Peace Spring"" in Hasakeh countryside.

According to SOHR sources, the villages captured by the al-Hamzaat Division were: ""Qatina, Al-Hardana, Al-Dawiri, Masajid and Tal al-Barm"". Al-Hamzaat Division cultivates civilian land and steals its produce.

On the other hand, people's complaints and anger were increasing due to the imposition of high levies by the factions. The people of the southern countryside of Ras Al Ain complained of the imposition of levies in unspecified amounts on passers-by at the checkpoints of Um al-Debs, Kua Shallah and Al-Mushirfeh.

In the areas of ""Putin-Erdogan"", the Salvation Government's General Authority of Zakat appointed an official in every olive pressing factory in areas under its control in order to collect ""zakat"" for the second consecutive year, since residents were forced to give this official an estimated 5% of the oil production. People refusing to pay had been threatened with arrest by security services or HTS-affiliated police outposts.

Meanwhile, a supervisory body affiliated to Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham monitored the work of those officials and imposed large penalties on those seen as lenient officials, despite a significant decline in olive crops and oil production in 2020.

In the areas of the ""Olive Branch"", the factions of ""Falcons of the North"", ""Al-Muntasir Billah"" and ""Suleiman Shah"", known as ""Abu Amsha"", and ""Al-Jabha Al-Shamiya"" imposed levies on the people during the olive season and confiscated their production. The Syrian Observatory monitored 250 seizures of homes and shops by factions in Afrin in 2020.

On the other hand, the places of worship have not been exempt from vandalism and looting, as members of Turkish-backed factions looted the contents of the ""Mar Touma"" Syriac Church in Churches neighbourhood in Ras al-Ain within the ""Peace Spring"" areas in Al-Hasakeh countryside.

Meanwhile, SOHR sources have confirmed that members of the regime-backed 5 Corps have stormed a mosque in Al-Baq'aa neighbourhood in the west of Al-Lajat area in the eastern countryside of Daraa, destroying the mosque's ""minbar"" (a pulpit in a mosque where the imam stands to deliver sermons) and sabotaging its contents. Moreover, the regime-backed militiamen prevented the residents from entering the mosque or even get close to it under the pretext that the mosque and its facilities be used by regime forces only.

Turkish-backed factions' violations have extended to religious and archaeological sites as well, and the Syrian Observatory has exposed ongoing archaeological excavations, acts of vandalism and destruction of religious shrines in search for antiques. The factions have vandalized more than 25 archaeological sites, searching for antiquities, as they relied on inexperienced workers who used tools and means that were not commensurate with these delicate works. Not to mention the smuggling of Syria's artifacts to Turkey where they are sold for large sums of money.

In mid-April, reliable sources informed the Syrian Observatory that militants of ""Sultan Suleiman Shah"" faction, known as ""Al-Amshat"", began excavations and search for antiquities on the archaeological hill of Arnada in ""Al-Sheikh Hadid"" area in the western countryside of Afrin. Furthermore, the hill was exposed to excavation work almost daily by members of ""Sultan Suleiman Shah"" using heavy diggers. Such excavations and random search for antiquities caused significant damage and massive destruction to the hill. Similarly, ""Sheikh",,,,,
"Hamid"""" shrine", located in the village of Qastal Jando in Sharran district in Afrin countryside, experienced similar excavations and sabotage. It is worth noting that this shrine is a holy place for Yazidi Kurds and is also frequented by the region's Muslims, and it is also a historical monument of Afrin canton. Residents of the canton accused members of Turkish-backed factions of such excavations, with the full knowledge and consent of Turkish intelligence which often facilitated these actions.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turkish-backed factions, supported by Turkish forces, cut down forests and trees in the village of Routanli in Ma'abatli district," after taking approval from the Turkish-backed """"Samarkand"""" faction there.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In mid-March 2020, Observatory sources reported that members of Turkish-backed factions cut down a large number of trees in Al-Mahmoudiyah neighbourhood in the centre of Afrin, as factions' members continued to cut down trees in various areas in countryside.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the """"de-escalation zone""""", Hayyaat Tahrir Al-Sham and factions work widely in excavation for antiquities in Idlib and its surrounding areas, where the province is witnessing a widespread antiquities trade, particularly with the facilities provided by Turkish officers in order to smuggles and sells these antiquities in Turkey.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strengthening Russian presence in Syria through ongoing support for Assad regime, agreements with Turkey and attempts to exclude Iran from the scene,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has sought to strengthen its presence in Syria and maximise its gains by supporting regime forces in their military operations in Aleppo and Idlib against jihadist factions, as well as in the Syrian desert against ISIS.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Aleppo and Idlib, Russian support enabled regime forces to capture 3000 areas at the beginning of the year, and took full control of the Damascus-Aleppo international road, after which the Russians reached understandings with the Turkish side by signing an agreement between the two parties on March 5,2020, in Moscow," known as the """"de-escalation zone"""" agreement.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
The agreement stipulated the following: announcement of a temporary ceasefire, establishing a security corridor and conducting joint Turkish-Russian patrols on the Latakia-Aleppo international road, resulting in 26 joint patrols in 2020, as Russia sought to preserve its own interests and presence on Syrian international roads.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Additionally, Russia had been conducting joint patrols with the Turks in NE Syria, and strengthening its presence on the Hasaka-Aleppo international road in order to consolidate its influence in the Syrian oil-reach areas, and in American-backed areas, seeking to shift the balance of power in Syria in its favour.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia was also seeking to implement a policy of """"interim dominance"""" by controlling Iranian strongholds in southern Aleppo countryside", and redeploying around Idlib region.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Furthermore, Russia had apparently given tacit consent to Israeli strikes on Iranian strongholds in Syria in order to curb Iranian influence in the eastern Euphrates and the desert region and to end Tehran's military presence in Syria.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also," Russia carried out intensive airstrikes on areas under the control of the factions under the pretext of countering """"terrorist organizations"""".",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the Russian desire to change the balance of power in Syria, and particularly in the provinces of Al-Suwayda and Daraa," through its """"Fifth Corps"""" was clear for all to observe.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2020, SOHR activists documented the deaths of 1,236 people in aerial and rocket attacks by Russian forces on different positions across Syria. The fatalities were distributed as follows:,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
On December 10, Russian forces opened their first headquarters in Al-Bokamal city in eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, near the Syria-Iraq border.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Russian-backed """"5 Corps"""" started to deploy its forces in several posts on the Syria-Iraq border near Al-Bokamal city. It is worth noting that several Iranian-backed militias", including Al-Nujabaa' Movement," the Iraqi Hezbollah and """"Al-Abdal""""", had handed over several posts to the 5 Corps, in accordance with a Russian-Iranian agreement, in reference to the end of the Russian-Iranian cold war.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
That support was reflected through an agreement between Tehran and Damascus on strengthen military and security cooperation, under which Iran supplied Syria with its most modern weaponry, especially 3 Khordad air defence systems.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, Iranian forces continued recruiting more people to their ranks in southern Syria and western Euphrates region," as """"Shi'aism"""" proselytising operations (conversion to Shiite) were still underway in public through the offering of financial incentives and continuous usage of religion and sectarianism.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to SOHR statistics, the number of volunteers in southern Syria has exceeded 8,600. While the number of recent recruits in the ranks of Iranian forces and loyal militias in the west Euphrates region has risen to nearly 7,450 Syrian young males and adult men.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iranian militias intentionally intensify these recruitment operations," exploiting Russia's preoccupation with recent agreements with Turkey regarding the """"de-escalation zone"""" and north-eastern Syria.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Daraa province," the Iranians and Hezbollah continued recruiting more people via pro-Iranian spiritual figures in """"Saraya al-Areen"""" of the 313th Brigade in northern Daraa", and Shiite centres in Sayda, Da'el, Izraa. It is worth noting that the recent recruits undergo training courses in Al-Lajat area in eastern Daraa.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Similarly, in Al-Quneitra, near the border with the occupied Syrian Golan, the Lebanese Hezbollah continued strengthening its presence by recruiting young people who had failed to join the mandatory and reserve military service of regime's security branches. In addition, the Iranians exploited the lack of job opportunities, attracting more people. Conversion to Shiite and recruitment operations are concentrated in Al-Baath city and Khan Arnabah.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
While in the west Euphrates region, recruitment was noticeably escalating in 2020 in the area from Al-Mayadin to Al-Bokamal in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor, which is fully controlled by Iranian forces.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020 | Significant Israeli escalation on Syrian territory,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new measure is aimed at cracking down on black-market activities and money laundering , and ""empowers federal regulators to design measures that would remove secrecy from transactions,"" Small writes. The Treasury Department will be in charge of developing the new rules this year.

Gagosian appears to have closed up shop in the City by the Bay, the San Francisco Chronicle says. Its sign has come down, and its phone is disconnected. The mega-gallery opened there in 2016, in a Kulapat Yantrasast-designed space a stone's throw from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

mongArt Industry News is a daily digest of the most consequential developments coming out of the art world and art market. Here's what you need to know on this Monday, January 4.

Artist Known for Defacing Art Basel Banana Settles With Trump - Rod Webber, the publicity-seeking prankster performance artist best known for scrawling the words ""Epstein Didn't Kill Himself"" across Maurizio Cattelan's viral banana installation at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2019, has reached a $20,000 settlement with the Trump campaign over a very different intervention. Webber was allegedly thrown ""head first"" into a table by a Trump campaign staffer when he tried to ask the then-presidential candidate a question during a New Hampshire campaign event in 2015. (Business Insider)

Louis Kahn-Designed Buildings in India Face Demolition - Plans to demolish the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad are on hold as the World Monuments Fund, among other heritage organizations, call on the institute's administration to reconsider. The buildings designed by one of America's most famed architects had, they say, considerable influence on ""modern development of Indian higher education."" The institute maintains that the dormitories are unlivable as slabs are falling off the roof, among other structural issues. (NYT)

Nashville Gallery Owner Vows to Rebuild - The owner of an art gallery in Nashville that was heavily damaged by the Christmas Day blast has vowed to rebuild and reopen. Ashley Bergeron Segroves, the founder of the Studio 208, says the ""lively"" downtown area now feels like a ""war zone."" But in a statement on her gallery's website, she noted that she felt fortunate -- she lives in back of the gallery and emerged unscathed. While she lost one major work, by local artist Kristin Llamas, ""the rest of our collection survived, even after many pieces were thrown across the room."" (Fox News)

The Architectural Paradox of Berlin's Humboldt Forum - The €633 million building in Berlin is controversial from most angles, but even based on its architecture alone, there are plenty of issues. Top of the list: the building lies on the rubble of the East German Palast der Republik, ""a museum in itself,"" laments FT's architecture critic Edwin Heathcote. The former East German parliament building was destroyed after German reunification under the pretense of asbestos (similar buildings had the toxin removed without being razed). The new palace ""now sits at the dead center of Berlin and has created exactly that: a dead center."" (Financial Times)

Congress Due to Apply New Regulations to Antiquities Market - The National Defense Authorization Act, which the US Congress passed on Friday by overriding President Trump's veto, has some art trade-relevant material in the fine print. The sprawling bill contains a move to broaden the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, which increased federal scrutiny of financial transactions, to include the trade of ancient artifacts. (NYT)

National Gallery Adds Works by Black Artists - The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, has acquired 40 works from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation. The purchase, which was three years in the making, adds examples by 21 Black painters, quilters, and sculptors to the museum's collection, including works by Lonnie Holley, Mary Lee Bendolph, and Thornton Dial. (New York Times)

Another Monolith Is Here - Oh, I'm sorry, you thought we could leave monolith mania behind in 2020? No such luck. Yet another silvery metal column -- what is it now, the fifth? -- has joined the fray, materializing near Salisbury in Wiltshire, UK, on New Year's Day. It was first discovered by a dog walker and, before long, began attracting attention on social media. (The Art Newspaper)

Director Named for Saudi Arabia's National Museum - Laila Alfaddagh has been tapped to lead Saudi Arabia's National Museum. From 2010 to 2017, she served as secretary of the King Abdul Aziz Center for World Culture. (Artforum)

Indigenous Museum Leader Marshall McKay Dies - The Northern California Indigenous leader of Pomo-Wintun heritage, who served as the first Indigenous chairman on the board of the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, died at 68 due to complications from COVID-19. A founding member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, McKay was described by the Autry's director as ""one of the five -- maybe even three -- significant Native leaders in the late 20th century and early 21st century."" (Los Angeles Times)

Chris Ofili on Philip Guston - The British artist -- no stranger to inciting controversy -- penned an essay on Philip Guston's 1969 painting City Limits, which depicts three hooded Klansmen riding in a car. ""Somehow, the sun never sets in this painting,"" Ofili writes, ""but also, no matter how long I stare at the horizon, the sun never rises to shed light on the dark slots of the eyeholes and windows.""

Art Enters Penn Station - Penn Station has long been the thorn in the side of many New Yorkers -- a necessary evil to get where one needs to go. But as part of a long-in-the-works overhaul, the new Moynihan Train Hall is welcoming permanent installations by such celebrated artists as Kehinde Wiley, Stan Douglas, and the duo Elmgreen & Dragset.

122,:Article,news,The First Veto,380793764,2021-01-03T12:27:00Z,0.003921569,"Congress began the new year by repassing the National Defense Authorization Act over Trump's veto, finding the two-thirds majority it needed to override one of Trump's vetoes for the first time. The House of Representatives passed the bill on Monday by a vote of 322 to 87. The Senate vote was 81 to 13, with 6 Senators not voting.

The NDAA allocates the money Congress has appropriated for the military, and since Congress passed the first NDAA in 1961, it has never failed to pass.

This measure pushed back on a number of the president's policies and demands. He wanted to be able to sue social media companies for things other people post on them -- the law preventing such lawsuits is in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act -- but even staunch Trump supporter James Inhofe (R-OK) refused, noting that Section 230 has nothing to do with the military. Trump objected to the measure in the bill that requires renaming military bases that currently bear the name of Confederate generals; Congress left it in. Congress also specified that federal authorities must ""visibly display"" their name tags when operating in public, a rebuke to the administration's deployment of officers in unmarked clothing this summer.

The NDAA also challenges Trump's policies by slowing or stopping the removal of troops from Germany and Afghanistan, making it harder to move troops to our southern border, and blocking the removal of troops from South Korea unless the Pentagon signs off on the move. It caps at $100 million the amount of money the military can use on domestic projects, a protest of the president's decision to fund his wall by moving $3.6 billion from other projects.

The NDAA also contains strong anti-corruption measures. Originally passed as the Corporate Transparency Act, these measures prohibit so-called shell companies with secret owners and operators, key tools of criminals and money launderers. The NDAA also regulates the antiquities trade, another haven for money laundering. The director of Transparency International's U.S. office, Gary Kalman, called the bill ""one of the most important anti-corruption measures ever passed by the U.S. Congress.""

After the Senate repassed the bill, Trump took to Twitter to call the Republican Senate ""Pathetic!!!""

As the veto override indicates, the war between Trump and establishment Republicans is now out in the open. On the one hand are lawmakers who are publicly backing Trump and his on-going attempt to overturn the election; on the other hand are Republicans who don't want to sign on to an assault on our democracy that, if it succeeds, would make Trump a dictator and remove all their power.

House lawmakers have indicated they will challenge some of the state electoral votes for Biden when Congress counts them on January 6. The process of gerrymandering, which protects Republicans from moderate challengers but leaves them open to challenges from extremists, has put a number of Republican radicals in the House, but the Senate has far fewer of them. A challenge from one house of Congress does not do anything, but a challenge to a state's electoral votes from both the House and the Senate means that both houses must debate whether or not to accept the electoral votes from that state. Then they decide by a simple majority vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has tried to keep Senate Republicans from challenging any of the votes because he doesn't want Republicans to have to go on record either for or against the president. The election was not close. Biden won by more than 7 million votes and by 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. The Trump campaign has either lost or had dismissed 60 of the 61 cases it has brought over the election, and its advisers are increasingly unhinged.

Today, for example, a Trump-appointed federal judge threw out a lawsuit filed by Louie Gohmert (R-TX) that sought to empower Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden's victory. Pence had opposed the lawsuit, and after the judge ruled, attorney Lin Wood, who is a supporter of the Trump effort, bizarrely predicted that Vice President Mike Pence could ""face execution by firing squad"" for ""treason."" (Twitter suspended his account.) Trump himself today retweeted an 8-minute video claiming that the Communist Party in China has secretly infiltrated America through Hollywood and newspapers and has bought Joe Biden. It urges ""patriots"" to defend America. To the tweet, Trump added: ""January 6th. See you in D.C.""

It seems clear that, with no chance of proving this election fraudulent, Trump is now trying to incite violence. Nonetheless, Republicans who are jockeying for the 2024 presidential nomination want to make sure they can pick up Trump's voters. While McConnell doesn't want Senators to have to declare their support either way, those vying to lead the party want to differentiate themselves from the pack.

On Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) announced he would join the efforts of his House colleagues to challenge Biden electors from Pennsylvania and perhaps other states. This will not affect the outcome of the election, but it will force senators to go on record for or against Trump. In a statement, Hawley listed Trump talking points: the influence of ""mega corporations"" on behalf of Biden and ""voter fraud."" Hawley seems pretty clearly to be angling for a leg up in 2024.

On Wednesday night, Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) made his own play for the future of the Republican Party. He refuted point by point the idea that Trump won. He scolded his colleagues who are signing on to Trump's attempt to steal the election, calling them ""institutional arsonists.""

""When we talk in private, I haven't heard a single Congressional Republican allege that the election results were fraudulent - not one,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Instead, I hear them talk about their worries about how they will ""look"" to President Trump's most ardent supporters."" They think they can ""tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage,"" he wrote, but they're wrong. ""Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.""

Today, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his own bid to redefine the Republican Party with an attack on Trump's apparent botching of the coronavirus vaccine rollout. In a press release, Romney noted ""[t]hat comprehensive vaccination plans have not been developed at the federal level and sent to the states as models is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.""

But he didn't stop there. Romney went on to say that he was no expert on vaccine distribution, ""[b]ut I know that when something isn't working, you need to acknowledge reality and develop a plan -- particularly when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake."" He offered ideas of his own, offering them ""not as the answer but as an example of the kind of options that ought to be brainstormed in Washington and in every state."" After listing his ideas, he concluded: ""Public health professionals will easily point out the errors in this plan -- so they should develop better alternatives based on experience, modeling and trial.""

Romney's statement was about more than vaccine distribution. With its emphasis on listening to experts and experimenting, it was an attack on the rigid ideology that has taken over the Republican Party. Romney has said he comes to his position from his own experience, not his reading, but he is reaching back to the origins of conservative thought, when Irish statesman Edmund Burke critiqued the French Revolution as a dangerous attempt to build a government according to an ideology, rather than reality. Burke predicted that such an attempt would inevitably result in politicians trying to force society to conform to their ideology. When it did not, they would turn to tyranny and violence.

Sasse's point-by-point refutation of Trump's arguments- complete with citations -- and Romney's call to govern according to reality rather than ideology are suggestive. They seem to show an attempt to recall the Republican Party to the true conservatism it abandoned a generation ago.",6371396306,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/heather-cox-richardson/94586/the-first-veto,,,

127,:Article,news,US poised to apply banking regulations to antiquities market,595115309,2021-01-02T05:31:00Z,0.02745098,"New York: The antiquities trade, which regulators have long feared provided fertile ground for money laundering and other illicit activities, will be subject to greater oversight under legislation passed by Congress on Friday when it overrode President Donald Trump's veto.

The provisions tightening scrutiny of the antiquities market were contained within the sprawling National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump vetoed last week and which the House and Senate voted to override on Monday and on Friday.

Regulators have long worried that the opacity of the antiquities trade, where buyers and sellers are seldom identified, even to the parties in a transaction, made it an easy way to shroud illicit transfers of money. The new legislation empowers federal regulators to design measures that would remove secrecy from transactions.

Money laundering risk

""We believe this type of legislation is long overdue,"" said John Byrne, a lawyer with 30 years of experience in anti-money-laundering rules. ""This is an area where clearly organized crime, terrorists, and oligarchs have used cultural artifacts to move illicit funds.""

Dealers resisted the move. But with the new legislation, Congress moved to broaden the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, which increased federal scrutiny of financial transactions, to include the trade of ancient artifacts.

Exactly how the new law works will be determined over the next year by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau within the Treasury Department, in consultation with the private sector, law enforcement and the public. Legal experts expect that the new antiquities regulations will be similar to others governing the precious metal and jewelry industries, where certain transactions are flagged to the authorities, who then determine whether they are suspicious. The law also seeks to end the use of shell companies to conceal the identities of buyers and sellers.

Urgent need for reforms

Sponsors of the new measure described it as a much-needed reform.

""Over the last decade, we've been working with all the industries and stakeholders to build a bill that satisfies everyone,"" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who introduced the Corporate Transparency Act in 2019 and later shepherded that bill into the defense package. ""We are at a point that we've built so much support that it became impossible to oppose the bill.""

The Corporate Transparency Act faced opposition from antiquities dealers, who balked at the requirement to disclose client information and at the added costs of complying with the law. The art industry has fought similar legislation that would have extended the Bank Secrecy Act into the art market.

Federal disclosures show that the auction house Christie's has paid lobbyists more than $100,000 over the past two years to influence the outcomes of such measures. A spokesperson for the auction house, Erin McAndrew, said its compliance department already maintains standards to protect against money laundering that were adopted by the European Union in 2018.

She said that ""Christie's welcomes the opportunity to work with U.S. regulators on appropriate and enforceable"" guidelines to combat money laundering in the art market.

Long pending demand

Watchdogs have urged Congress to tighten regulations on the antiquities trade for years. The looting of cultural heritage sites in countries like Syria and Iraq has resulted in a growing black market for Middle Eastern antiquities. Law enforcement abroad has seized hundreds of artifacts, which officials believe trace back to earlier excavations carried out by terrorist groups like ISIS.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" said Tess Davis, executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, a nonprofit organization that monitors the illicit trade of artifacts.

""A pawnshop's business model does not differ greatly from that of a Sotheby's or Christie's,"" she added. Pawnbrokers fall under the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act, but auction houses do not. ""Why should the rules be stricter for a mom-and-pop business hawking stereos in Milwaukee than a billion-dollar auction house in Manhattan?""

Concerns overblown?

But some dealers claim that reports of black-market transactions and money laundering are overblown. One dealer, Randall A. Hixenbaugh, president of a nonprofit organization called the American Council for the Preservation of Cultural Property, has called statistics on the illicit trade unfounded and argued against the new regulations.

""Virtually all transactions of high-dollar amounts in the ancient art business are handled through financial institutions and instruments already covered by the Bank Secrecy Act,"" Hixenbaugh said. ""Criminals seeking to launder ill-gotten funds could hardly pick a worse commodity than antiquities.""

Legislative staffers who helped craft the new regulations said that they were guided by what they learned in Congressional hearings and from industry experts. UNESCO warned earlier this year that the development of online sales platforms and social networks had facilitated the illicit sale of antiquities and that existing regulations had failed to stem the black market.

The new legislation calls for a study on the role of art in money laundering and terror financing. (A recent Senate report has already outlined how at least two Russian oligarchs had exploited the opaqueness of the art world to bypass U.S. sanctions.) If the study finds a link between the art market and illicit activity, it could, upon congressional review, trigger the creation of rules similar to the ones now concerning the antiquities trade. Regulators have also signaled that the Bank Secrecy Act could be further extended into the art market.",6369919069,https://gulfnews.com/business/banking/us-poised-to-apply-banking-regulations-to-antiquities-market-1.1609566035470,,,

The looting of cultural heritage sites in countries like Syria and Iraq have resulted in a growing black market for Middle Eastern antiquities. Law enforcement abroad has seized hundreds of artifacts, which officials believe trace back to earlier excavations carried out by terrorist groups like ISIS.

""The proposed legislation will begin to close a major loophole,"" said Tess Davis, the executive director of the Antiquities Coalition, a nonprofit organization that monitors the illicit trade of artifacts.

""A pawnshop's business model does not differ greatly from that of a Sotheby's or Christie's,"" she added. Yet pawnbrokers fall under the purview of Bank Secrecy Act, but auction houses do not. ""Why should the rules be stricter for a mom-and-pop business hawking stereos in Milwaukee than a billion-dollar auction house in Manhattan?""

But some dealers claim that reports of black-market transactions and money-laundering are overblown. One dealer, Randall A. Hixenbaugh, the president of a nonprofit organization called the American Council for the Preservation of Cultural Property, has called statistics on the illicit trade unfounded and argued against the new regulations.

""Virtually all transactions of high-dollar amounts in the ancient art business are handled through financial institutions and instruments already covered by the Bank Secrecy Act,"" Mr. Hixenbaugh said. ""Criminals seeking to launder ill-gotten funds could hardly pick a worse commodity than antiquities.""

Legislative staffers who helped craft the new regulations said that they were guided by what they learned in Congressional hearings and from industry experts. Unesco warned earlier this year that the development of online sales platforms and social networks had facilitated the illicit sale of antiquities and that existing regulations had failed to stem the black market.

The new legislation calls for a study on the role of art in money laundering and terror financing. (A recent Senate report has already outlined how at least two Russian oligarchs had exploited the opaqueness of the art world to bypass U.S. sanctions.) If the study finds a link between the art market and illicit activity, it could, upon congressional review, trigger the creation of rules similar to the ones now concerning the antiquities trade. Regulators have also signaled that the Bank Secrecy Act could be further extended into the art market.

""You have to know who is buying and selling,"" Mr. Byrne said. ""The argument that you have no obligation to report suspicious activity because you are in the private sector doesn't work. Banks lost that argument 30 years ago.""",6369550801,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/arts/design/antiquities-market-regulation.html,,,

132,:Article,news,Want to Buy Some Stolen Antiquities? Try Facebook.,515727970,2020-12-09T18:11:00Z,0.011764706,"Somewhere in Yemen, a thief's left hand grips a severed bronze head, rotating it for appraisal. His right hand holds a camera, which he uses to focus on the details of the figure. In spite of the poor lighting and shaky camerawork, the statue's features are clear: coiled hair, crooked nose, hollow eyes. Once he's uploaded the video to Facebook, it has plenty of company. Since at least 2014, when ISIS expanded its revenue streams to include the plunder of archeological sites in Syria and Iraq, Facebook has become a clearinghouse for looters and purveyors of stolen cultural artifacts.

You might think a black market for antiquities would exist out of sight, a system of whispers and shadows requiring code words for entry. The reality is banal -- disturbingly so. Accessing the black market for antiquities is no more difficult than requesting membership in the popular ""Dogspotting"" Facebook group. Facebook's ""Groups"" feature lets users connect efficiently and (sort of) discretely to share the locations of loot like Egyptian coffins. According to the Antiquities Trafficking and Heritage Anthropology Research (ATHAR) Project -- the only group of its kind monitoring social media -- Facebook is the wellspring of the modern illicit antiquities trade, where traffickers thrive because of the platform's laissez-faire regulation.

In June, after half a decade of persistent activism from archaeologists and terrorism experts and a U.N. Security Council report that cited Facebook as ""a tool for the illicit trafficking of cultural property,"" the social network updated its community standards -- the official guidelines about which posts should get removed -- to include a ban on selling, trading, and soliciting ""historical artifacts."" Headlines praised Facebook for its ""anti-looting crackdown,"" and for taking a stance. This is a familiar refrain. Multiple times over the past decade, with begrudging acknowledgment, Facebook has nominally banned a number of illegal trades through its community guidelines.

Alas, news of these crackdowns must never have reached traffickers, who continue to deal in human remains, illegal drugs, and endangered wildlife on the platform. Since the policy change, ATHAR has noted the continued growth of active Facebook trafficking groups -- from 120 in June to more than 130 by November.

These groups total more than 2 million members (though some may be part of more than one group), and they serve a dual function. Primarily, they are ""traditional"" black marketplaces, where prospective buyers can post requests alongside posts of looters detailing their finds. Community members express initial interest through comments, often speculating on the origin, age, and value of the pictured objects. Most, however, are browsers. Genuine shoppers complete the actual transaction behind the encrypted walls of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

In addition, the groups function as a training ground for a new generation of looters. Experienced members -- including those connected to violent extremist groups -- share techniques, provide excavation tutorials, and offer pricing guidelines as a way to help amateurs expand the market. Meanwhile, the administrators of these groups -- who often collect cuts from money exchanged in transactions -- are highly connected individuals, with influence extending into the legitimate antiquities market in the West. Artifacts looted by ISIS-affiliated thieves in Syria, may, thanks to Facebook, end up in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.

War is a primary facilitator of illegal trafficking on Facebook and beyond. Within the 95 Middle Eastern Facebook Groups analyzed by the ATHAR project in 2019, 36 percent of posts selling artifacts came from conflict zones and 44 percent came from countries bordering those zones. This is no coincidence. There has been ample documentation on the use of antiquities trafficking to fund operations of extremist organizations such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and Hurras Al-Din. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict -- adopted as a result of Nazi looting in World War II -- has long since made the ""theft, pillage, or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property"" illegal as a matter of international law. It is also, predictably, a federal crime in the United States to engage in black market dealings.

So how has Facebook evaded accountability?

The 1996 Communications Decency Act Section 230 -- drafted long before the advent of social media -- protects internet platforms from liability for the actions of third-party posters. Facebook remains shielded even though the black market heavily depends on the platform's predictive algorithms to lead buyers to new trafficking groups -- not to mention the unambiguous illegality of the black marketeers' activities. Also, because Facebook is a U.S. company, foreign governments lack the authority to moderate Facebook content. Nations hit hard by looting have to go through the U.S. State Department to petition for memorandums of understanding to limit imports to the U.S. of historical artifacts. But with the broad reach of social media, the success of such import restrictions is limited. Syria, one of only 17 countries with such an agreement, now sees historical artifacts being sold into Turkey before coming to the U.S. under false pretenses, despite FBI warnings.

Unlike traditional cloak-and-dagger networks, however, the black market on Facebook is easily accessible to anyone who searches for it -- including monitors and regulators. If just a handful of experts at ATHAR are capable of monitoring more than 2 million members of antiquities trafficking groups, there is no reason to believe Facebook's claims about the intractability of regulating the problem itself. Facebook has the means to, at the very least, keep track of and limit the most egregious trafficking. By failing to act, Facebook facilitates the destruction of cultural heritage and enables terrorism. (Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.)

Policing the sale of severed heads of sculptures would pose no threat to Facebook's bottom line. Fighting the destruction of world heritage would not hurt the company's ad revenue. Facebook has every incentive to repair its increasingly tarnished reputation, made worse daily by its aiding and abetting of violence and viral falsehoods.

Change to Facebook's regulatory practices requires public outrage over the destruction of cultural property, over the abuse of vulnerable communities that have had their heritage held hostage and sold for component parts.

But this isn't an intractable problem. ATHAR has already proved that a cost-efficient approach to curbing trafficking crime on Facebook exists. Facebook only needs to hire a handful of archeological experts to identify, document, and report black market activities -- a drop in the bucket for a multibillion-dollar company.

Until then, the private collectors and institutions who receive decapitated Yemeni statues should thank their benefactor with a placard: ""Looted courtesy of Facebook.""",6336334685,https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/facebook-stolen-antiquities-art-black-market.html,,,

136,:Article,news,"After outcry from antiquities trade, Unesco further adjusts ad campaign on looted artefacts ",603797962,2020-12-08T12:00:00Z,-0.176470588,"Dealers association challenged the campaign's claims that two newly pictured objects were stolen A blurb in a Unesco ad campaign against illicit trafficking in antiquities stated that a statuette was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo in 2014. That wording was later revised. Unesco

An advertising campaign by Unesco that calls attention to illegal art trafficking has undergone further revision after accusations that it misrepresented the background of the objects pictured in the ads.

The campaign, titled ""The real price of art"" and conceived with the Paris ad agency DDB, depicts art objects in elegant Western interiors with captions indicating that they were looted from their countries of origin. Last month, Unesco hastily pulled back three images of objects that had been culled from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection -- a Buddha's head, a funerary monument and a mask -- after the Met complained and others pointed out that the works were not looted in recent years as the ads claimed and in fact had a much longer provenance.

Those high-resolution images, all in the public domain, were evidently harvested from the Met's website, although the advertising text did not identify the Met as the owner of the objects. Also pulled from the ad campaign was an image of Pre-Columbian vessel from Peru that was apparently a stock image from the photo agency Alamy.

In swapping out the images last month and publicly expressing its ""regrets"" to the Met, the UN agency retained just one work of art of the five it originally used in the campaign: a 15th-century panel from the Ghent Altarpiece that was verifiably stolen in 1934 in Belgium.

It immediately added two others: a statuette of a Sumerian Woman With Polos, or headdress, dating from 2650-2350BC (it was originally mistakenly labeled 2659-2350AD) that Unesco said was looted in 2014 from the National Museum of Aleppo in Syria, and a tribal mask dating from the early 20th century that it said was stolen in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast ""when fighting broke out following the crisis of 2010.""

Lazare Eloundou, the director of culture and emergencies at Unesco, told The Art Newspaper then: ""To avoid any misunderstanding on the purpose of the campaign, the campaign is now exclusively composed of items that have been looted.""

The problem was that neither of the added objects was looted: both still reside in museums in their country of origin, as the International Association of Dealers in Ancient Art (IADAA) pointed out last week in its monthly newsletter. ""Unesco may well regret the embarrassment, but it doesn't seem to have learned from it as the two hastily inserted replacement photos for the campaign testify,"" wrote Ivan Macquisten, an industry consultant who is also an occasional contributor to The Art Newspaper.

The Aleppo statuette, which in reality is small, is reproduced in the ad at several times its size atop a bookcase next to a fuzzy armchair in a well-appointed living room.

The National Museum of Aleppo and the Syrian government's directorate-general of antiquities and museums in Damascus, which oversees the institution, did not respond to requests for information on the whereabouts of the statue. Several scholars contacted by The Art Newspaper confirmed that the statuette remains in the museum, however, including Zainab Bahrani, a professor of ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology at Columbia University.

The statuette can also be glimpsed in a video about the reopening of the Aleppo museum last year. A separate video prepared by the Syrian tourism authority, the IADAA newsletter notes, quotes Khaled Al-Masri, director of Aleppo museums and antiquities, as stating that despite an attack on the museum with mortars and missiles a few years earlier, the collection inside was totally preserved rather than looted.

After the IADAA newsletter went out, Unesco changed the text of the ad depicting the Woman With Polos. Under the headline ""Supporting an armed conflict has never been so decorative,"" it had read: ""This priceless antiquity was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo when the fighting was at its peak in 2014, before being smuggled into the European market."" Now the underlying blurb says: ""A priceless antiquity similar to this was stolen from Syria, when the fighting was at its peak in 2014, before being smuggled into the European market.""

A blurb in a Unesco advertisement after being changed to eliminate the contention that a statuette was stolen from the National Museum of Aleppo Unesco

Asked where this similar antiquity had resided before its reported theft, a Unesco spokeswoman said in an email, ""If you think there was no looting in Syria of objects similar to the Woman in Polos, we leave it to you to state this in your article."" No further explanation was given.

Unesco has said that the ad campaign underlines the severity of the threat from illegal trafficking in art and artefacts and has been acclaimed by member states. ""All images and texts used in the current campaign have been carefully chosen and drafted in cooperation with all the institutions concerned,"" says a statement from the culture and heritage sectors of the agency relayed by the Unesco spokeswoman.

The director of the Musée des Civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire in Abidjan, Silvie Memel-Kassi, confirmed by email that the mask described in the campaign as having been looted from her museum is still in the collection. A similar mask by the same sculptor was stolen from the museum during an armed conflict in 2011, however, along with other objects from the institution, she adds.

A blurb in a Unesco ad says the mask depicted was looted after a crisis in 2010 in Abidjan. The director of the Musée des Civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire in Abidjan says it remains in the museum's collection, however. Unesco

Memel-Kassi emphasises that she authorised the use of the photo, which she says was originally shot in 2016 and distributed to advance an awareness campaign about stolen objects. That image also accompanied a recent article she wrote about illicit trafficking of Ivorian collections for The Journal of Art Market Studies.

""The National Museum of Côte d'Ivoire is a partner of Unesco, and therefore supports the campaign of this organization which, in my humble opinion, responds to the aspirations of member states,"" she says in an email. ""The image we have given enters into this concept of illicit traffic. This is why we did not hesitate for a single moment.""

Memel-Kassi adds: ""The antique dealers who protest against the use of this image certainly have their reason which I ignore.""

Unesco also confirmed that Memel-Kassi ""gave us her full permission to use the image of the mask, and agreed to the text accompanying the image"".

But representatives of the antiquities trade counter that the blurb accompanying the image of the mask is deceptive. They note that the text, under the headline ""How do you erase a whole culture? Piece by piece,"" reads: ""This African art object was looted in Abidjan when fighting broke out following the crisis of 2010.""

Since the IADAA sent out its newsletter, another work of art has been added to the ad campaign: an Inca ceramic jug from Peru dating from 1470-1532 that Unesco says was looted in an illegal excavation at an unspecified date. The object is certain to be scrutinised by those associated with the antiquities trade.

""Several things indicate how poorly Unesco have handled this updated campaign,"" Macquisten said in an email. ""They still list the tribal mask as looted, when it was not. The Woman With Polos is depicted roughly at a scale of around three times its actual size,"" and ""the original caption was made up, as our evidence showed and as their alteration to it now shows."" He adds that the campaign was supervised by at least five Unesco officials named in the online version of the ad campaign, ""none of whom acknowledges any real wrongdoing even now"".

The antiquities trade has long been at loggerheads with Unesco, of course, accusing the agency of overstating the dimensions of illicit trafficking in antiquities, including Unesco's current $10bn global estimate, and undermining what dealers claim are legitimate sales.

Last month, Cinoa, the international federation of art and antiquities dealers associations, protested the inclusion of images of objects in the Met's collection. ""The campaign is fraudulent, with the desired intention to mislead the public on the provenance of works of art and to damage the credible reputation of the art trade and collectors,"" Cinoa's president, Clinton R. Howell, wrote then in a letter to the director general of Unesco, Audrey Azoulay.

Erika Bochereau, secretary general of Cinoa, says in an email that her group has been working with Unesco to ""suggest effective and focused legislation that enables the legitimate trade to flourish"". She adds, ""We however, cannot accept the insinuation of Unesco's latest campaign that the art trade operates in an untrustworthy way with criminal groups.""

The campaign, which opened on 20 October, is timed to the 50th anniversary of the 1970 Unesco convention against illicit trafficking in cultural property, which the UN agency marked in November.",6334176230,http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/unesco-further-adjusts-ad-campaign-on-looted-artefacts-after-outcry-from-antiquities-trade,,,

However, demands for the return of objects like the Kohinoor and the Amravati marbles have been turned down.

An 18th century idol of Goddess Annapoorna, stolen from India about a century back, will soon be making its way back to the country from Canada. The statue, holding a bowl of kheer in hand, had once adorned a temple on the riverbanks of Varanasi, and was stolen by lawyer Norman McKenzie sometime in the early 20th century. Since then, it has been part of the McKenzie art gallery collection at the University of Regina, Canada. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the idol would be repatriated by the Canadian government. In a statement, University of Regina's Vice-Chancellor Thomas Chase said the act of repatriation will help ""overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible"".

""One of the very first Indian words to enter the English language was the Hindustani slang for plunder: loot,"" writes historian William Dalrymple in his most recent work, 'The anarchy: The relentless rise of the East India Company'. The word which had originated in the plains of northern India, entered British vocabulary by the 18th century. Incidentally, that was also the time when hundreds of artefacts, paintings, coins, manuscripts and much else were shipped across to England by colonial officers.

Dalrymple goes on to describe the colossal amount of loot made by the first governor of the Bengal presidency Robert Clive kept in the Powis Castle in Wales. ""There are more Mughal artefacts stacked in this private house in the Welsh countryside than are on display in any one place in India... The riches include hookahs of varnish gold inlaid empurpled ebony, superbly inscribed Badakhshan spinels and jeweled daggers; gleaming rubies the colour of pigeon's blood, and scatterings of lizard-green emeralds,"" he writes.

But colonial loot was systematic and made to look lawful. With the Independence of the country, similar plunder continued, but now it became an act of crime. Names like Subhash Kapoor, Vijay Nanda, Deenadayalan continue to be investigated in connection with millions of dollars worth of smuggled cultural heritage. ""The primary difference is in the sense of ownership. In the pre-independence period when the colonisers were doing it, there was a rhetoric of victory. It wasn't really looting as much as a sense of entitlement,"" says Samayita Banerjee, research scholar in History at Ashoka University, who has been doing extensive research on heritage conservation. ""Post Independence it becomes a matter of theft as there exist laws to protect antiquities.""

Over the years, thousands of artefacts of cultural importance to India have found themselves in museums and exhibitions abroad. ""UNESCO has estimated that more than 50,000 art objects were smuggled out of India over the decade 1979-1989 alone,"" writes international law expert Jeanette Greenfield in her book, 'The return of international treasures'. In recent years, repatriation of stolen art objects have gained currency. The records of the Archaeological Survey of India show that the government has been able to retrieve 40 art objects between 2014 and 2020, and 75-80 art objects are in the pipeline to be returned. Yet while some return, others continue to remain in faraway lands, carrying within them an uneasy history of plunder and pillage.

""The major interpretative strategy by which India was to become known to Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries was through a construction of a history of India,"" writes anthropologist Bernard S. Cohn in his celebrated work, 'Colonialism and its forms of knowledge.' He notes that it was the British in the 19th century, who in an authoritative way defined what is valuable among objects found in India. ""It was the patrons who created a system of classification and determined what was valuable, that which would be preserved as monuments of the past, that which was collected and placed in museums, that which could be bought and sold, that which would be taken from India as mementos and souvenirs of their own relationship to India and Indians,"" he writes.

Perhaps the most significant among objects that made its way to the British Museum through this process of exploration and classification of Indian history is a Buddhist shrine, the Amravati Stupa which was established in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh in the 3rd century BCE. It came into public attention in the late 18th century, when Colin Mackenzie excavated and recorded it. By 1845, Sir Walter Elliot removed parts of the sculpture and kept them in the Madras Museum, from where they were transferred to London in 1859, under the assumption that it would get spoiled in India. At present, it occupies a separate gallery in the British Museum, and unlike the Kohinoor, there is hardly any political rhetoric around its retrieval.

Mackenzie had been employed by the governor-general of India, Lord Wellesley, to conduct a survey of artefacts, oral histories and religion in South India. By the end of his career, objects collected by him included 6,218 coins, 106 images, 40 antiquities, 1,568 manuscripts, as well as copies of inscriptions and copper plates from temples. In the 1820s, after the death of Mackenzie, orientalist H H Wilson dispatched his entire collection to London. Some of these were put on display at the small museum which the Company had at its headquarters in Leadenhall Street.

The British Museum contains a large volume of Indian artefacts, a majority of which are from the collection of Major General Charles Stuart. Stuart lived in India between 1777 till his death in 1828. Nicknamed 'Hindoo Stuart', he was known for his fascination with Indian sculpture, primarily from Bihar, Bengal, Orissa, and central India. His collection was bought by John Bridge at an auction in London in 1829-30. The British Museum acquired the collection from his heirs in 1872.

By the end of the 18th century, a number of EIC officials had returned back to England and were actively trying to maintain the repository of Indian cultural heritage they had acquired in India. A result of this was the collection of the India Office Records in the British Library. In 1801, it purchased its first huge collection of miniature paintings from retired company servant Richard Johnson. Similar collections of paintings of Hindu deities and other religious relics were also donated or sold by other company officials like John Flaming and Francis Buchanan Hamilton.

Some of the most famous among such objects which are still in England include a white nephrite jade wine cup belonging to Shah Jahan currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the seventh-century Sultanganj Buddha which is in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Then there were the war booties from India. The most famous among these of course is the Kohinoor which the British took under its possession after winning the second Anglo-Sikh war in 1849. Currently, it is on public display in the Tower of London and continues to attract political attention regarding its repatriation. But there are other such objects as well like Maharaja Ranjit Singh's throne, decorated with rich gold sheets, also acquired during the Anglo-Sikh war. Currently, it is kept in the Victorian and Albert Museum in London. Then there is Tipu's Tiger, an 18th-century mechanical toy that was carried away by the British when they stormed Tipu's capital in 1799. It was later transferred to the Victorian and Albert Museum in London.

Towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, there emerged an idea of retaining and conserving India's past. ""There emerged a growing consciousness to preserve the archaeological heritage of India. Curzon alongside John Marshall who was the director-general of the ASI were avid proponents of conservation,"" explains Banerjee. Thereafter the effort to conserve the archaeological and cultural heritage of the country continued well into the period after Independence. In 1904, the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act was passed, which was followed by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958.

However, the exit of colonial powers ushered in a new phase of heritage theft. Archaeologist Vinay Kumar Gupta, in a research paper 'Retrieval of Indian antiquities: Issues and challenges', writes that the ""lawful and organised looting of colonial powers changed into unlawful and disorganised looting"" which was possible due to the ""lack of strong anti-smuggling laws in former colonies."" He writes: ""In India, the easiest target of smugglers have been the abandoned ancient temples, religious mathas, or platforms on the outskirts of villages and archaeological mounds which are illegally dug out from time to time.""

For instance, in 1976, a labourer digging up a field at Panthur village of Thanjavur district found a bronze idol of Lord Nataraja. He sold it off to a Canadian collector who in turn sent it to a curator at the British Museum. In 1991, however, the Nataraja was returned to Tamil Nadu.

Another remarkable case of heritage smuggling was that of the eight idols including the bronze Nataraja at the Brihadeshwara temple in a small village named Sripuranthan in Tamil Nadu. In 2006, they were stolen and smuggled out by the US-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor. In 2008 it was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia. After the theft was exposed, the Australian government returned the Nataraja idol along with another idol of Shiva to India in March 2014.

There are many other pieces of antiquities, however, that continue to remain abroad. ""From Khajuraho alone over 100 erotic sculptures had been stolen from the period between 1965 and1970,"" write Banerjee and research scholar Ishani Ghorai in an article for the online portal Sahapedia titled, 'Antiquities theft and ilicit antiquities trade in India.' They note two other famous cases of theft, one being the sensational case of burglary in the Jaipur palace museum when 2,492 medieval period paintings went missing, and the other was the 1968 theft at the National Museum in New Delhi when 125 pieces of antique jewellery and 32 rare gold coins were stolen.

Speaking about the loopholes that allow such blatant plunder of cultural heritage even today, Banerjee says, ""when I do my fieldwork what comes across to me is the lack of education about heritage."" She adds, ""Say a person residing at a remote village in Bengal, he would probably not know why he needs to keep a 2nd century CE bronze sculpture. Also, there is very little monetary compensation for him, if at all. That is exactly what these networks of theft exploit.""

In recent times though, there has been a conscious attempt by the ASI to detect smuggled objects and by museums abroad to return stolen artefacts. In September this year, the UK returned three ancient idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita stolen from Tamil Nadu in 1978. In 2018, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York announced its decision to return an eighth-century stone sculpture of Goddess Durga and a limestone sculpture dating to the third century CE. More recently, the Australian government decided to return two 15th century door guardians from Tamil Nadu and a sculpture of a serpent king from either Madhya Pradesh or Rajasthan.

At the same time, however, demands for the return of objects like the Kohinoor and the Amravati marbles have been turned down. In 2013, when British prime minister David Camaron was on a visit to India he was asked about the repatriation of the Kohinoor to which he replied that he did not support 'returnism' since it would empty out British museums.

Speaking about why it is more difficult for those objects which were shipped out during the colonial era to be returned, former director of antiquities in the ASI, DM Dimri says, ""at that time India was part of the British empire. So an object removed from here and sent to London, was a mere shifting of location. Therefore they cannot be considered an illegal export.""

""When it comes to objects that were taken 100 or 200 years back by colonial powers, it is not clear whether we can call it stolen or not. Once it is clear that an object is stolen in the modern sense of the term, it becomes easier to return it,"" says Vinod Daniel who is Chair, AusHeritage and board member of International Council of Museums (ICOM). ""But a lot depends on the repatriation policy of the institution or country concerned. For instance, the Australian Museum has a clear policy that anything with social or religious significance that has been brought from another country will be returned if there is a request,"" he adds.

In the last few years, growing public demand has emerged for the return of stolen objects. In 2014, two Singapore-based Indian art enthusiasts, S. Vijay Kumar and Anuraag Saxena, started the India Pride Project which uses social media to identify Indian cultural artefacts abroad and initiate their return. The group was active in ensuring that the Sripuranthan Nataraja was returned to India.

""History belongs to its geography,"" says Saxena about the objective behind the project. ""We are glad that through our initiative we have been able to bring this issue to public consciousness. Another impact I think we have had is to have a political consensus around this matter,"" says Saxena.

Speaking about what more needs to be done to ensure that cultural heritage of the country is preserved, Saxena says, ""there needs to be a national register or repository of all our heritage."" ""Secondly, India needs to have a special task force that deals with this problem,"" he adds. ""Unless India claims what is rightfully ours, we cannot claim our place in the world.""

The SOHR pointed out that the arrested officer was using cars that traveled with Turkish military convoys to smuggle antiquities, noting that the Turkish forces tightened surveillance on Turkish and Syrian forces after the incident.

According to the opposition sources of the SOHR, there is a group of Turkish officers in Idlib working in the Syrian antiquities trade and transporting them from the Arab Republic to unknown destinations.

They reported that the region is witnessing increasing illegal excavations, with the facilities of Turkish officers in the disposal of archaeological finds.

The Observatory said that the jihadists of Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) have been working for a long time, excavating antiquities on public or private lands, after their owners were forced to agree, and selling antiquities through smuggling to Turkey.",6320986986,https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/turkish-forces-arrest-officer-responsible-for-smuggling-antiquities-out-of-syria/,,,

443,:Article,news,"Recently Enacted NDAA Expands The Bank Secrecy Act To Regulate The Antiquities Trade (And Possibly Eventually The Art Market) - Government, Public Sector - United States",976593484,2021-01-20T12:25:00Z,0.145098039,"To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.

The expansive National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA) that Congress enacted on January 1, 2021 (over President Trump's veto), extends the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to the trade of ancient artifacts. The NDAA also calls for a study into whether Congress likewise should broaden the BSA to regulate the wider art market.

Although the BSA already regulates the financial institutions that facilitate many of the high-dollar transactions in the antiquities trade, Section 6110 of the NDAA (Section 6110) amends the BSA to apply directly to persons ""engaged in the trade of antiquities, including an advisor, consultant, or any other person who engages as a business in the solicitation or the sale of antiquities."" Exactly how the antiquities market will be regulated is not yet specified. Over the next year, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCen), in coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies, will promulgate the federal regulations that will spell out how the BSA will impact the antiquities trade.

Section 6110 directs FINCen to take into account the following considerations, among others, when issuing these new regulations: (i) which entities should be subject to rulemaking (taking into account factors such as size, type of business, domestic or international geographical locations); (ii) the degree to which the regulations should focus on high-value antiquities trades; and (iii) the need for disclosure of the identities of the actual, beneficial purchasers of antiquities, the purchasers' agents or intermediaries, and dealers, advisors, consultants, or any other persons who engage as a business in the trade in antiquities.

Section 6110 also directs the Treasury Department to study the extent to which the art market is used to facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing. This study is to be geared toward understanding the following issues, among others: (i) the extent to which the US financial system is impacted by bad actors using the art market to facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing; (ii) whether information on certain art transactions would be useful in criminal, tax, or regulatory matters; (iii) which art markets, if any, should be subject to regulation; (iv) the degree to which the regulations should focus on high-value trade in works of art; and (v) the need for disclosure of the identities of the actual, beneficial purchasers of works of art, the purchasers' agents or intermediaries, and dealers, advisors, consultants, or any other persons who engage as a business in the trade in works of art. Congress ultimately could decide to direct FINCen to issue rules regulating the art trade similar to those that it has directed FINCen to issue for the antiquities trade.

It is also worth noting that, as we explained in detail in our June 3, 2020 Advisory and follow-up December 3, 2020 post, the NDAA cracks down on people hiding behind shell companies to commit financial crimes by requiring many US companies to disclose to the federal government for the first time the identities of their beneficial owners.

Even before the new antiquities amendment, the NDAA's anti-money laundering and terrorism financing reforms garnered much attention by commentators due to their broad scope and significant impact on businesses that must disclose client information and bear the added costs of complying with the law. Now, thanks to Section 6110, these effects will also be felt in a new market sector, the antiquities trade, and possibly eventually the art industry as well.

The jury is out on whether extending the BSA to cover antiquities will actually make much of a practical difference. Payments for most large antiquities transactions in the United States are already handled through financial institutions and therefore are already regulated by the BSA. Moreover, many of the large, legitimate players in the art and antiquities markets already have robust compliance programs that meet BSA standards. Accordingly, it seems that the impact of these reforms, and the enforcement burden, will be greatest on small-scale transactions and on smaller dealers of antiquities and art, who may be less likely to have strong AML compliance controls in place and who are more likely to engage in cash transactions that would not already be screened by financial institutions' BSA programs.",6397470428,https://www.mondaq.com/Article/1027568,,,

445,:Article,news,Forget bandages: This first-ever Egyptian mud-wrapped mummy dates,287649423,2021-02-08T19:40:00Z,-0.003921569,"According to a new research paper published last week in the online journal PLOS One, its unusual ""mud carapace"" indicates an ancient a mortuary treatment never documented in the entire Egyptian archaeological record.

While theories abound as to the reasons this method was used, one possibility is that the mud covering was meant to be a budget attempt at replicating the resin-based procedure of embalmment employed by the ultra rich, who were often mummified with imported resin from the late New Kingdom to the 21st Dynasty, roughly the period from 1294 B.C. to 945 B.C.

""Mud is a more affordable material,"" explained the project's lead researcher Karin Sowada, of the Department of History and Archaeology at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.

Besides the crunchy mud shell protecting the corpse, this particular mummy of a woman who died between the ages of 26 and 35 appeared to have been damaged after its demise and was found lying in an incorrect coffin intended for a female who had perished much more recently.

According to the study, this particular archaeological specimen and its accompanying coffin were obtained in the mid-1800s from Sir Charles Nicholson, an English-Australian politician and antiquities collector who took it with him to Australia. Nicholson generously donated the relics to the University of Sydney in 1860, where they are now housed at its Chau Chak Wing Museum.

However, it seems that the adventurous Sir Nicholson was duped into buying a mismatched set as the mummy dates back further than the coffin, something that occurred with great frequency as Egyptian treasures were being rounded up an sold to private individuals, academic institutions, and museums in the 19th century.

""Local dealers likely placed an unrelated mummified body in the coffin to sell a more complete 'set,' a well-known practice in the local antiquities trade,"" Sowada and her colleagues wrote. ""The coffin is inscribed with a woman's name -- Meruah or Meru(t)ah -- and dates to about 1000 B.C., according to iconography decorating it, meaning the coffin is about 200 years younger than the mummy in it.""

Back in 1999 during a computed tomography (CT) scan of the mummy, scientists saw some interesting images that led them to carefully extract samples of the original wrappings and saw that they were layered with a sandy mud mixture. Researchers re-scanned the specimen in 2017 and identified more intriguing details about the carapace following a chemical analysis of the crumbling bandages and ancient mud flakes.

Sowada and her crew have speculated that after dying, this person was mummified and wrapped in the normal linen tradition of the times. Damaged to her left knee and lower leg was probably caused by grave robbers shortly after her death. Indications of repair means that someone tended to the body by rewrapping, packing and padding it with textiles, and finally covered the entire corpse with a mud mixture.

""Whoever repaired the mummy made a complicated earthy sandwich, placing a batter of mud, sand and straw between layers of linen wrappings. The bottom of the mud mixture had a base coat of a white calcite-based pigment, while its top was coated with ochre, a red mineral pigment,"" Sowada said. ""The mud was apparently applied in sheets while still damp and pliable. The body was wrapped with linen wrappings, the carapace applied, and then further wrappings placed over it.""

More injury was inflicted upon the mummy towards the modern era, this time to the right side of the neck and head, which necessitated the insertion of steel pins to the affected regions.

""This is a genuinely new discovery in Egyptian mummification,"" Sowada added. ""This study assists in constructing a bigger -- and a more nuanced -- picture of how the ancient Egyptians treated and prepared their dead.""",6425348305,https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/egyptian-mud-wrapped-mummy-dates-back-over-3200-years,,,

Remains thought to belong to Khaled al-Asaad, the distinguished archaeologist who was killed by Islamic State group (IS) militants for obstructing their rampant destruction of ancient treasures, have been found in Syria's Palmyra.

Asaad, who had been in charge of the ancient Greco-Roman site for decades, was executed in public by IS in 2015, after refusing to lead them to hidden troves of artefacts he had buried for safe keeping.

His corpse was reportedly left dangling from one of the ancient columns in the centre of a square in Palmyra.

Syrian officials said tests were underway to identify three corpses found near the site. Assad's son Tarek told The National: ""The authorities informed us two days ago and my brother Mohammed provided yesterday a blood sample for the DNA test which will require 72 hours for the results.""

""We have high hopes that the body will be of our late father and that God will not disappoint us,"" he added.

Asaad worked with foreign archaeologists from across the globe, assisting with research into the famous UNESCO world heritage site. His death prompted an outpouring of grief from across the world, and is considered a symbol of resistance against the Islamic State group and a marker of its extreme brutality.

IS's self-declared ""caliphate"", which was expunged by military campaigns between 2014 and 2019, lay across a third of Syria and Iraq and contained some of the richest archaeological treasures on earth.

While IS made a show of desecrating antiquities under a religious pretext, the group also raised cash from the looting of the Middle East's treasures, which were then sold to middlemen operating on the European black market.

Relics from the ancient site of Palmyra are known to have appeared in the shop windows of antique sellers in London's upmarket Mayfair district.

In 2015, Irina Burkova, then head of the UN's cultural agency Unesco, said ancient sites in Syria and Iraq were being looted on an ""industrial scale"", after reports that one-fifth of Iraq's about 10,000 official world-renowned sites had fallen under IS control.

Looting and black market antiquities trade continues, despite the demise of IS.

Tarek al-Asaad said he wanted to ""honour"" his father by having his remains buried in the garden of the Palmyra National Museum, if the DNA results showed that one of the bodies is indeed him.

""We will then have the honour, as a family, to escort the remains of our father and our role model to his final resting place. We hope that this place will be the garden of the Palmyra National Museum, as his last request before he was executed was to visit the museum and take his last breaths there,"" he said.

452,:Article,news,Museum of the Bible Returns Looted Artifacts to Egypt and Iraq,662888043,2021-02-05T19:06:00Z,-0.02745098,"President of the U.S. arts and crafts store, Hobby Lobby, and board chairman of the Washington D.C.-based Museum of the Bible, Steve Green, has returned thousands of potentially looted artifacts to Egypt and Iraq, the Museum announced in a recent statement.

Another artifact previously seized from the museum was the famous Gilgamesh Dream Tablet which featured the Sumerian epic. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)The items were part of the museum's collection and included some 5,000 papyri fragments from Egypt and more than 8,100 clay tablets from Iraq.

Green said he came into possession of the artifacts over years of private collecting, and announced in March his intention to return them.

""In 2009, when I began acquiring biblical manuscripts and artifacts for what would ultimately form the collection at the Museum of the Bible, I knew little about the world of collecting,"" Green said in March.

""I trusted the wrong people to guide me, and unwittingly dealt with unscrupulous dealers in those early years. One area where I fell short was not appreciating the importance of the provenance of the items I purchased,"" he said.

The artifacts were found by the museum's own researchers to have insufficient providence records, i.e a documented trail of possession beginning with their excavation.

""When I purchased items in those early years, dealers would make representations about an item's provenance, which the consultants I employed would say was sufficient. As I came to understand taking a dealer at his or her word was not good enough,"" Green said in March.

Accurate and legal provenance is a key measure to stem the tide to the illegal antiquities trade, estimated by Standards Chartered Bank to be a multi-billion dollar industry

The looting of cultural property from active war zones is also considered a war crime under the 1954 Hague Convention.

False provenance records are often fabricated by suspect dealers and smugglers to get illegally acquired artifacts off the black market and into legitimate auction houses, while the artifacts proceeds can then be used for money laundering purposes or to fund terrorism and organzied crime.

The trove of artifacts began making their way back home in January Green said. ""We understand the U.S. government has now delivered the papyri to Egyptian officials"" he explained. ""On January 27, 2021, we initiated the shipment of the 8,106 clay objects to The Iraq Museum in Baghdad.""

However, the recent load of artifacts was far from Greene's first run in with the illegal antiquities trade.

In 2017, his company Hobby Lobby, was forced to pay a US$3 million dollar fine by the U.S. Dept of Justice and return thousands artifacts to Iraq that it was accused of smuggling.",6421553646,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13803-museum-of-the-bible-returns-looted-artifacts-to-egypt-and-iraq,,,
453,:Article,news,Who Changed The Bodies and What is The Real Name of The Egyptian Mummy? | Al Bawaba,222197567,2021-02-04T20:52:00Z,-0.02745098,"Experts from Macquarie University in Sydney detail the discovery in a new paper.

In a potentially ancient case of mistaken identity, a new study reveals that an Egyptian mummy likely wasn't the person named on the front of its coffin.

Aussie scientists performed computerised tomography (CT) scans and radiocarbon dating on the mummy and coffin, currently housed at the University of Sydney.

The mummified female body dates as far back as the year 1200 BC, while the coffin in which the mummy resides was constructed in the year 1000 BC, they found.

The body may have been inserted by a crafty Egyptian dealer into what was at the time an empty coffin at some point during the 19th century, just before it was bought for the university.

Analysis also reveals a 'rare' painted mud carapace enclosing the adult mummy - a hard resinous shell used to protect the body within its wrappings.

'The date of the individual is earlier than that of the coffin,' say the team of researchers, led by Dr Karin Sowada from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, in their paper.

'Local dealers likely placed an unrelated mummified body in the coffin to sell a more complete ""set"", a well-known practice in the local antiquities trade.'

The mummified individual and coffin are currently in the Nicholson Collection of the new Chau Chak Wing Museum, which opened to the public in November last year, on the University of Sydney's main campus.

Sir Charles Nicholson, an English explorer who spent much of his career in Australia during the 19th century, bought the mummified body, lidded coffin and mummy board as a set during a trip to Egypt in between 1856 and 1867.

In 1860, Sir Nicholson donated it to the University of Sydney and two years later returned to live in England.

The coffin inscription on the lid identifies the owner as a titled woman named Meruah, and the iconography dates it to approximately 1000 BC.

'The date of the coffin has been established through analysis of the coffin shape, design and decoration,' Dr Sowada told MailOnline.

'It is a well-known type from the Theban area of Egypt (region of modern Luxor).'

Although the mummified individual underwent a full computed tomography (CT) scan in 1999, the authors rescanned the body for their current study using updated technology.

Using this new visualisation of the teeth and skeleton, the authors determined the mummified individual was a fairly young adult, aged between 26 and 35 years.

Body scans did not reveal external genitalia and internal reproductive organs had been removed during the mummification process.

However, ossified secondary sexual characteristics, including hip bones, jaw, and cranium, strongly suggest the mummified individual was female, challenging the finding of a 2005 study that identified the mummy as a male from DNA.

'Our specialist research team is confident of the identification of the sex as female based on the skeletal characteristics seen on the new scans outlined in the paper,' Dr Sowada told MailOnline.

'The DNA test was conducted over 20 years ago and much has changed in this area since.

'Thus, given the opinion of our team, we must face the possibility that there was a problem with the earlier DNA result.'

Analysis of the mummification technique and radiocarbon dating of textile samples from the linen wrappings placed the mummified individual to somewhere between the years 1200 to 1113 BC.

This makes it likely that the female lived during the 20th Dynasty of Egypt - the third and last dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian New Kingdom period.

The new scans also revealed the extent and nature of the mud carapace, showing the mud shell fully sheaths the body and is layered within the linen wrappings.

Images of the inmost layers indicate the body was damaged relatively shortly after initial mummification, and the mud carapace and additional wrappings were applied to reunify and restore the body.

In addition to its practical restorative purpose, the authors suggest the mud carapace was a much cheaper way of replicating burial practices of the wealthy.

It gave those who cared for the deceased the chance to 'emulate elite funerary practices' of coating the body in an expensive imported resin shell, but instead making use of cheaper and locally available materials.

Though this mud carapace treatment has not been previously documented, the authors note it's not yet possible to determine how frequent this treatment may have been for non-elite mummies in the late New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.

Therefore, further radiological studies on other non-royal mummies may reveal more about this practice, researchers say.

That might be the explanation behind a case of mistaken mummy identity.

During a trip to Egypt in the late 1850s, Sir Charles Nicholson -- an English Australian antiquarian, university founder and philanthropist -- bought a mummified body, coffin and mummy board, which he donated to the University of Sydney in 1860, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. The mummy was a socially esteemed woman named Meruah, according to the coffin inscription that dates back to around 1000 BC. A separate group of researchers discovered the coffin's age in 1988. The mummified body had been encased in a mud shell, or carapace, but that wasn't discovered until 1999 during a project led by Karin Sowada, the first author of the current study. That's because computed tomography scans had only recently become possible. New technology allowed the researchers to perform virtual dissections and therefore better characterize the layers of the carapace around the body in 2017. That's when The University of Sydney was preparing to open its Chau Chak Wing Museum, ""which has a dedicated space for the ancient Egyptian material of the Nicholson Collection,"" said Sowada, a research fellow in the department of history and archaeology at Macquarie University's main campus in Sydney, via email.Read MoreThe shell's layers were made of minerals, which differed from the expensive resin used for mummified elite individuals. ""This is the first time that a painted mud carapace treatment has been discovered,"" Sowada added. Through analysis of samples from the mummy's linen wrappings, the researchers also found that the person lived in the late New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period from around 1200 BC to 1113 BC. That meant that the body was much older than the coffin.""Many coffins were robbed of their original occupants in ancient times. It's likely that in the local antiquities trade of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many coffins for sale were empty,"" said Sowada via email. ""Dealers obtained complete mummified bodies found in desert cemeteries and placed them in coffins to sell complete 'sets' to tourists, even though bodies and coffins may not have belonged together. ""It was fashionable for foreign tourists to return home with an Egyptian mummy."" Samples of DNA taken from the body about 15 years ago indicated that the person was a male, but the conclusion has shifted back to probably a female who had lived 26 to 35 years. The authors updated their conclusions by studying secondary sexual characteristics, which are features that appear when humans go through puberty, like when females might develop wider hips, or when males might grow more and thicker facial hair. The body's internal reproductive organs had been removed during the mummification process, and genitalia weren't seen on the scans, so more detailed analyses of DNA samples are needed, Sowada said. ""However, this would require further invasive engagement via destructive testing, and that needs to be carefully considered on a number of levels."" The shifting of determinations about a mummy's sex ""happens all the time,"" said Peter Lacovara, the director of The Ancient Egyptian Archaeology and Heritage Fund and consulting curator for the Egyptian Collection at the Albany Institute of History and Art in New York state. ""At the Albany Institute, we had a mummy that had been earlier identified as a female, and we took it to be tested and it turned out to be a male.""""It's sometimes harder to tell with ancient bodies; there seems to be less distinction, or we pick it up less clearly."" The DNA collected back then may have been contaminated, the authors said. The body also experienced damage shortly after the initial mummification, including the separation and displacement of the cranium, the jawbone and parts of the spine. Some bones were far away from their rightful place -- the left kneecap was at the level of the left ankle, and the right kneecap was below the top of the left thigh bone. Some bones were fractured. ""Mummification dessicates and stabilises the bodily tissues, so we would expect to see very little (if any!) post-depositional movement or disarticulation of any bones,"" Sowada said via email. ""The CT scans of this person's body shows us that they were subject to significant disruption -- but also, importantly, that they were provided with a great deal of care to restore them after they had been disturbed."" The body was then subjected to rewrapping, packing and padding with fabrics, and the application of the mud shell. The mud carapace ""likely fulfilled a threefold purpose,"" the study said. It was a form of conservation for a body that had gone through significant damage, for one, and may have served a symbolic purpose as well. ""The carapace aided the metaphysical transition of the deceased into the afterlife and the sphere of the god Osiris,"" the study said. ""The mythological experiences of this underworld deity -- his death, dismemberment, re-establishment and re-birth -- had long been established to serve as a precedent for the mortuary experience of all Egyptians. ... Like the god, the deceased could also hope for continued existence in the afterlife, when properly prepared."" ""Mud itself was associated with the idea of regeneration and growth,"" Sowada said, ""so it would have been a symbolically significant material to use.""Lastly, because the minerals comprising the mud shell were options less expensive than the resin used for elite mummified individuals, they might have enabled the repairers to display status by emulating the mummification practices for elite people. The red pigment used for the part of the shell covering the face was a bit uncommon for women mummified during that period. ""This practice relates to the belief that women took on a temporary, crucial, postmortem masculine aspect in death so that they could be reconceived and reborn into the afterlife via their own images (in the same way that male tomb owners were believed to undergo that process by means of representations of their female relatives or goddesses),"" said Heather McCarthy, an Egyptologist and deputy director of the New York University Epigraphical Expedition to the Ramesses II Temple at Abydos, via email. ""The use of masculine, red and red-brown skin tones is a pictorial signifier of that gender-fluid state.""The findings help to construct a bigger and more nuanced picture of how the ancient Egyptians treated and prepared their dead, Sowada said.

The ""mud carapace"" is an unparalleled find; it reveals ""a mortuary treatment not previously documented in the Egyptian archaeological record,"" the researchers wrote in the study, published online Wednesday (Feb. 3) in the journal PLOS One.

It's possible the ""mud wrap"" was used to stabilize the mummy after it was damaged, but the mud may have also been meant to emulate practices used by society's elite, who were sometimes mummified with imported resin-based materials during a nearly 350-year period, from the late New Kingdom to the 21st Dynasty (about 1294 BCE to 945 BCE), the researchers said.

So, why was this individual covered with mud, rather than resin?

""Mud is a more affordable material,"" study lead researcher Karin Sowada, a research fellow in the Department of History and Archaeology at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, told Live Science in an email.

The mud sheath isn't the mummy's only oddity. The mummy, dated to about 1207 BCE, was damaged after death, and was even interred in the wrong coffin actually meant for a woman who died more recently, the researchers found.

Like many ancient Egyptian mummies, the ""mud mummy"" and its lidded coffin were acquired in the 1800s by a Western collector, in this case, Sir Charles Nicholson, an English-Australian politician who brought it to Australia.

Nicholson donated them to the University of Sydney in 1860, and today they reside at the university's Chau Chak Wing Museum. But it appears that whoever sold the artifacts tricked Nicholson; the coffin is younger than the body buried in it, the researchers found.

Above: 3D-rendered CT images showing the mud carapace.

""Local dealers likely placed an unrelated mummified body in the coffin to sell a more complete 'set,' a well-known practice in the local antiquities trade,"" the researchers wrote in the study. The coffin is inscribed with a woman's name - Meruah or Meru(t)ah - and dates to about 1000 BCE, according to iconography decorating it, meaning the coffin is about 200 years younger than the mummy in it.

While the individual isn't Meruah, anatomical clues hint that it is a female who died between the ages of 26 and 35, the researchers said.

Researchers got their first inkling that the 3,400-year-old mummy was unusual in 1999, when a CT (computed tomography) scan revealed something strange inside. To investigate, the researcher extracted a few samples of the wrappings and discovered they contained a sandy mud mixture.

When a new team of researchers re-scanned the mummy in 2017, they uncovered previously unknown details about the carapace, especially when they chemically reexamined the mud fragments.

(Sowada et al. 2021/Chau Chak Wing Museum/Macquarie Medical Imaging/CC BY 4.0)

Above: CT images of the mummified person's internal features. The carapace can be seen as a thin white line.

After she died, the woman was mummified and wrapped in textiles. Then, her remains, including her left knee and lower leg, were damaged in ""unknown circumstances,"" possibly by grave robbers, which prompted someone to repair her mummy, likely within one to two generations of her first burial - a feat that included ""rewrapping, packing and padding with textiles, and application of the mud carapace,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

Whoever repaired the mummy made a complicated earthy sandwich, placing a batter of mud, sand and straw between layers of linen wrappings. The bottom of the mud mixture had a base coat of a white calcite-based pigment, while its top was coated with ochre, a red mineral pigment, Sowada said.

""The mud was apparently applied in sheets while still damp and pliable,"" she said. ""The body was wrapped with linen wrappings, the carapace applied, and then further wrappings placed over it.""

Later, the mummy was damaged again, this time on the right side of the neck and head. Because this damage affects all of the layers, including the muddy carapace, it appears this damage was more recent and prompted the insertion of metal pins to stabilize the damaged areas at the time, the researchers said.

This ""mud mummy"" isn't the only ancient Egyptian mummy subject to post-mortem repair; the body of King Seti I was wrapped more than once, and so were the remains of King Amenhotep III (King Tut's grandfather), the researchers noted.

As for the woman's mud carapace, ""this is a genuinely new discovery in Egyptian mummification,"" Sowada said. ""This study assists in constructing a bigger -- and a more nuanced -- picture of how the ancient Egyptians treated and prepared their dead.""",6418687266,https://www.sciencealert.com/archaeologists-uncover-an-ancient-egyptian-mummy-wrapped-in-a-strange-mud-cocoon,,,

The body also experienced damage shortly after the initial mummification, including the separation and displacement of the cranium, the jawbone and parts of the spine. Some bones were far away from their rightful place -- the left kneecap was at the level of the left ankle, and the right kneecap was below the top of the left thigh bone. Some bones were fractured.

""The carapace aided the metaphysical transition of the deceased into the afterlife and the sphere of the god Osiris,"" the study said. ""The mythological experiences of this underworld deity -- his death, dismemberment, re-establishment and re-birth -- had long been established to serve as a precedent for the mortuary experience of all Egyptians. ...

Lastly, because the minerals comprising the mud shell were options less expensive than the resin used for elite mummified individuals, they might have enabled the repairers to display status by emulating the mummification practices for elite people.

The red pigment used for the part of the shell covering the face was a bit uncommon for women mummified during that period.

That might be the explanation behind a case of mistaken mummy identity.

During a trip to Egypt in the late 1850s, Sir Charles Nicholson -- an English Australian antiquarian, university founder and philanthropist -- bought a mummified body, coffin and mummy board, which he donated to the University of Sydney in 1860, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.

The mummy was a socially esteemed woman named Meruah, according to the coffin inscription that dates back to around 1000 BC. A separate group of researchers discovered the coffin's age in 1988.

The mummified body had been encased in a mud shell, or carapace, but that wasn't discovered until 1999 during a project led by Karin Sowada, the first author of the current study. That's because computed tomography scans had only recently become possible.

New technology allowed the researchers to perform virtual dissections and therefore better characterize the layers of the carapace around the body in 2017. That's when The University of Sydney was preparing to open its Chau Chak Wing Museum, ""which has a dedicated space for the ancient Egyptian material of the Nicholson Collection,"" said Sowada, a research fellow in the department of history and archaeology at Macquarie University's main campus in Sydney, via email.

The shell's layers were made of minerals, which differed from the expensive resin used for mummified elite individuals. ""This is the first time that a painted mud carapace treatment has been discovered,"" Sowada added.

Through analysis of samples from the mummy's linen wrappings, the researchers also found that the person lived in the late New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period from around 1200 BC to 1113 BC. That meant that the body was much older than the coffin.

""Many coffins were robbed of their original occupants in ancient times. It's likely that in the local antiquities trade of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many coffins for sale were empty,"" said Sowada via email. ""Dealers obtained complete mummified bodies found in desert cemeteries and placed them in coffins to sell complete 'sets' to tourists, even though bodies and coffins may not have belonged together.

""It was fashionable for foreign tourists to return home with an Egyptian mummy.""

Samples of DNA taken from the body about 15 years ago indicated that the person was a male, but the conclusion has shifted back to probably a female who had lived 26 to 35 years. The authors updated their conclusions by studying secondary sexual characteristics, which are features that appear when humans go through puberty, like when females might develop wider hips, or when males might grow more and thicker facial hair.

The body's internal reproductive organs had been removed during the mummification process, and genitalia weren't seen on the scans, so more detailed analyses of DNA samples are needed, Sowada said. ""However, this would require further invasive engagement via destructive testing, and that needs to be carefully considered on a number of levels.""

Samples of DNA taken from the body about 15 years ago indicated that the person was a male, but the conclusion has shifted back to probably a female who had lived 26 to 35 years.

That might be the explanation behind a case of mistaken mummy identity.

During a trip to Egypt in the late 1850s, Sir Charles Nicholson -- an English Australian antiquarian, university founder and philanthropist -- bought a mummified body, coffin and mummy board, which he donated to the University of Sydney in 1860, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.

The mummy was a socially esteemed woman named Meruah, according to the coffin inscription that dates back to around 1000 BC. A separate group of researchers discovered the coffin's age in 1988.

The mummified body had been encased in a mud shell, or carapace, but that wasn't discovered until 1999 during a project led by Karin Sowada, the first author of the current study. That's because computed tomography scans had only recently become possible.

New technology allowed the researchers to perform virtual dissections and therefore better characterize the layers of the carapace around the body in 2017. That's when The University of Sydney was preparing to open its Chau Chak Wing Museum, ""which has a dedicated space for the ancient Egyptian material of the Nicholson Collection,"" said Sowada, a research fellow in the department of history and archaeology at Macquarie University's main campus in Sydney, via email.

The shell's layers were made of minerals, which differed from the expensive resin used for mummified elite individuals. ""This is the first time that a painted mud carapace treatment has been discovered,"" Sowada added.

Through analysis of samples from the mummy's linen wrappings, the researchers also found that the person lived in the late New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period from around 1200 BC to 1113 BC. That meant that the body was much older than the coffin.

""Many coffins were robbed of their original occupants in ancient times. It's likely that in the local antiquities trade of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many coffins for sale were empty,"" said Sowada via email.

In a potentially ancient case of mistaken identity, a new study reveals that an Egyptian mummy likely wasn't the person named on the front of its coffin.

Aussie scientists performed computerised tomography (CT) scans and radiocarbon dating on the mummy and coffin, currently housed at the University of Sydney.

The mummified female body dates as far back as the year 1200 BC, while the coffin in which the mummy resides was constructed in the year 1000 BC, they found.

The body may have been inserted by a crafty Egyptian dealer into what was at the time an empty coffin at some point during the 19th century, just before it was bought for the university.

Analysis also reveals a 'rare' painted mud carapace enclosing the adult mummy - a hard resinous shell used to protect the body within its wrappings.

'The date of the individual is earlier than that of the coffin,' say the team of researchers, led by Dr Karin Sowada from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, in their paper.

'Local dealers likely placed an unrelated mummified body in the coffin to sell a more complete ""set"", a well-known practice in the local antiquities trade.'

The mummified individual and coffin are currently in the Nicholson Collection of the new Chau Chak Wing Museum, which opened to the public in November last year, on the University of Sydney's main campus.

Sir Charles Nicholson, an English explorer who spent much of his career in Australia during the 19th century, bought the mummified body, lidded coffin and mummy board as a set during a trip to Egypt in between 1856 and 1867.

In 1860, Sir Nicholson donated it to the University of Sydney and two years later returned to live in England.

The coffin inscription on the lid identifies the owner as a titled woman named Meruah, and the iconography dates it to approximately 1000 BC.

'The date of the coffin has been established through analysis of the coffin shape, design and decoration,' Dr Sowada told MailOnline.

'It is a well-known type from the Theban area of Egypt (region of modern Luxor).'

Although the mummified individual underwent a full computed tomography (CT) scan in 1999, the authors rescanned the body for their current study using updated technology.

Using this new visualisation of the teeth and skeleton, the authors determined the mummified individual was a fairly young adult, aged between 26 and 35 years.

Body scans did not reveal external genitalia and internal reproductive organs had been removed during the mummification process.

However, ossified secondary sexual characteristics, including hip bones, jaw, and cranium, strongly suggest the mummified individual was female, challenging the finding of a 2005 study that identified the mummy as a male from DNA.

'Our specialist research team is confident of the identification of the sex as female based on the skeletal characteristics seen on the new scans outlined in the paper,' Dr Sowada told MailOnline.

'The DNA test was conducted over 20 years ago and much has changed in this area since.

'Thus, given the opinion of our team, we must face the possibility that there was a problem with the earlier DNA result.'

Analysis of the mummification technique and radiocarbon dating of textile samples from the linen wrappings placed the mummified individual to somewhere between the years 1200 to 1113 BC.

This makes it likely that the female lived during the 20th Dynasty of Egypt - the third and last dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian New Kingdom period.

The new scans also revealed the extent and nature of the mud carapace, showing the mud shell fully sheaths the body and is layered within the linen wrappings.

Images of the inmost layers indicate the body was damaged relatively shortly after initial mummification, and the mud carapace and additional wrappings were applied to reunify and restore the body.

In addition to its practical restorative purpose, the authors suggest the mud carapace was a much cheaper way of replicating burial practices of the wealthy.

It gave those who cared for the deceased the chance to 'emulate elite funerary practices' of coating the body in an expensive imported resin shell, but instead making use of cheaper and locally available materials.

Though this mud carapace treatment has not been previously documented, the authors note it's not yet possible to determine how frequent this treatment may have been for non-elite mummies in the late New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.

Therefore, further radiological studies on other non-royal mummies may reveal more about this practice, researchers say.

'The mud shell encasing the body of a mummified woman within the textile wrappings is a new addition to our understanding of ancient Egyptian mummification,' they write in their paper, published in the journal PLOS ONE.

EMBALMING THE DEAD IN ANCIENT EGYPT

It is thought a range of chemicals were used to embalm and preserve the bodies of the dead in ancient cultures.

Russian scientists believe a different balm was used to preserve hair fashions of the time than the concoctions deployed on the rest of the body.

Hair was treated with a balm made of a combination of beef fat, castor oil, beeswax and pine gum and with a drop of aromatic pistachio oil as an optional extra.

Mummification in ancient Egypt involved removing the corpse's internal organs, desiccating the body with a mixture of salts, and then wrapping it in cloth soaked in a balm of plant extracts, oils, and resins.

Older mummies are believed to have been naturally preserved by burying them in dry desert sand and were not chemically treated.

Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques have been deployed in recent years in find out more about the ancient embalming process.

Studies have found bodies were embalmed with: a plant oil, such as sesame oil; phenolic acids, probably from an aromatic plant extract; and polysaccharide sugars from plants.

The recipe also featured dehydroabietic acid and other diterpenoids from conifer resin.

The mummy was a socially esteemed woman named Meruah, according to the coffin inscription that dates back to around 1000 BC. A separate group of researchers discovered the coffin's age in 1988.

The mummified body had been encased in a mud shell, or carapace, but that wasn't discovered until 1999 during a project led by Karin Sowada, the first author of the current study. That's because computed tomography scans had only recently become possible.

New technology allowed the researchers to perform virtual dissections and therefore better characterize the layers of the carapace around the body in 2017. That's when The University of Sydney was preparing to open its Chau Chak Wing Museum, ""which has a dedicated space for the ancient Egyptian material of the Nicholson Collection,"" said Sowada, a research fellow in the department of history and archaeology at Macquarie University's main campus in Sydney, via email.

The shell's layers were made of minerals, which differed from the expensive resin used for mummified elite individuals. ""This is the first time that a painted mud carapace treatment has been discovered,"" Sowada added.

Through analysis of samples from the mummy's linen wrappings, the researchers also found that the person lived in the late New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period from around 1200 BC to 1113 BC. That meant that the body was much older than the coffin.

""Many coffins were robbed of their original occupants in ancient times. It's likely that in the local antiquities trade of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many coffins for sale were empty,"" said Sowada via email. ""Dealers obtained complete mummified bodies found in desert cemeteries and placed them in coffins to sell complete 'sets' to tourists, even though bodies and coffins may not have belonged together.

""It was fashionable for foreign tourists to return home with an Egyptian mummy.""

Samples of DNA taken from the body about 15 years ago indicated that the person was a male, but the conclusion has shifted back to probably a female who had lived 26 to 35 years. The authors updated their conclusions by studying secondary sexual characteristics, which are features that appear when humans go through puberty, like when females might develop wider hips, or when males might grow more and thicker facial hair.

The body's internal reproductive organs had been removed during the mummification process, and genitalia weren't seen on the scans, so more detailed analyses of DNA samples are needed, Sowada said. ""However, this would require further invasive engagement via destructive testing, and that needs to be carefully considered on a number of levels.""

The shifting of determinations about a mummy's sex ""happens all the time,"" said Peter Lacovara, the director of The Ancient Egyptian Archaeology and Heritage Fund and consulting curator for the Egyptian Collection at the Albany Institute of History and Art in New York state. ""At the Albany Institute, we had a mummy that had been earlier identified as a female, and we took it to be tested and it turned out to be a male.""

""It's sometimes harder to tell with ancient bodies; there seems to be less distinction, or we pick it up less clearly.""

The DNA collected back then may have been contaminated, the authors said.

The body also experienced damage shortly after the initial mummification, including the separation and displacement of the cranium, the jawbone and parts of the spine. Some bones were far away from their rightful place -- the left kneecap was at the level of the left ankle, and the right kneecap was below the top of the left thigh bone. Some bones were fractured.

""Mummification dessicates and stabilises the bodily tissues, so we would expect to see very little (if any!) post-depositional movement or disarticulation of any bones,"" Sowada said via email.

""The CT scans of this person's body shows us that they were subject to significant disruption -- but also, importantly, that they were provided with a great deal of care to restore them after they had been disturbed.""

The body was then subjected to rewrapping, packing and padding with fabrics, and the application of the mud shell. The mud carapace ""likely fulfilled a threefold purpose,"" the study said. It was a form of conservation for a body that had gone through significant damage, for one, and may have served a symbolic purpose as well.

""The carapace aided the metaphysical transition of the deceased into the afterlife and the sphere of the god Osiris,"" the study said. ""The mythological experiences of this underworld deity -- his death, dismemberment, re-establishment and re-birth -- had long been established to serve as a precedent for the mortuary experience of all Egyptians. ... Like the god, the deceased could also hope for continued existence in the afterlife, when properly prepared.""

""Mud itself was associated with the idea of regeneration and growth,"" Sowada said, ""so it would have been a symbolically significant material to use.""

Lastly, because the minerals comprising the mud shell were options less expensive than the resin used for elite mummified individuals, they might have enabled the repairers to display status by emulating the mummification practices for elite people.

The red pigment used for the part of the shell covering the face was a bit uncommon for women mummified during that period.

""This practice relates to the belief that women took on a temporary, crucial, postmortem masculine aspect in death so that they could be reconceived and reborn into the afterlife via their own images (in the same way that male tomb owners were believed to undergo that process by means of representations of their female relatives or goddesses),"" said Heather McCarthy, an Egyptologist and deputy director of the New York University Epigraphical Expedition to the Ramesses II Temple at Abydos, via email. ""The use of masculine, red and red-brown skin tones is a pictorial signifier of that gender-fluid state.""

The findings help to construct a bigger and more nuanced picture of how the ancient Egyptians treated and prepared their dead, Sowada said.

""It's likely that prior studies on mummified bodies in other collections, where a 'resin' carapace has been identified, will need to be re-examined for the possibility that the carapace is made of mud instead,"" she added. ""The application of scientific techniques to museum collections reveals the wealth of new information sitting right under our noses.""",6418412534,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/in-a-case-of-potential-mistaken-mummy-identity-scientists-uncover-clues-1.5294213,,,

494,:Article,news,Never-before-seen 'mud mummy' from Egypt discovered in wrong coffin,726502234,2021-02-03T19:00:00Z,-0.035294118,"This beautifully decorated coffin (right) doesn't belong to the unusual mud-wrapped mummy (left) that was found inside it.

The discovery of a rare ""mud mummy"" from ancient Egypt has surprised archaeologists, who weren't expecting to find the deceased encased in a hardened mud shell.

The ""mud carapace"" is an unparalleled find; it reveals ""a mortuary treatment not previously documented in the Egyptian archaeological record,"" the researchers wrote in the study, published online Wednesday (Feb. 3) in the journal PLOS One.

It's possible the ""mud wrap"" was used to stabilize the mummy after it was damaged, but the mud may have also been meant to emulate practices used by society's elite, who were sometimes mummified with imported resin-based materials during a nearly 350-year period, from the late New Kingdom to the 21st Dynasty (about 1294 B.C. to 945 B.C.), the researchers said.

So, why was this individual covered with mud, rather than resin? ""Mud is a more affordable material,"" study lead researcher Karin Sowada, a research fellow in the Department of History and Archaeology at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, told Live Science in an email.

The mud sheath isn't the mummy's only oddity. The mummy, dated to about 1207 B.C., was damaged after death, and was even interred in the wrong coffin actually meant for a woman who died more recently, the researchers found.

Like many ancient Egyptian mummies, the ""mud mummy"" and its lidded coffin were acquired in the 1800s by a Western collector, in this case, Sir Charles Nicholson, an English-Australian politician who brought it to Australia. Nicholson donated them to the University of Sydney in 1860, and today they reside at the university's Chau Chak Wing Museum. But it appears that whoever sold the artifacts tricked Nicholson; the coffin is younger than the body buried in it, the researchers found.

""Local dealers likely placed an unrelated mummified body in the coffin to sell a more complete 'set,' a well-known practice in the local antiquities trade,"" the researchers wrote in the study. The coffin is inscribed with a woman's name -- Meruah or Meru(t)ah -- and dates to about 1000 B.C., according to iconography decorating it, meaning the coffin is about 200 years younger than the mummy in it.

While the individual isn't Meruah, anatomical clues hint that it is a female who died between the ages of 26 and 35, the researchers said.

Muddy treatment

Researchers got their first inkling that the 3,400-year-old mummy was unusual in 1999, when a CT (computed tomography) scan revealed something strange inside. To investigate, the researcher extracted a few samples of the wrappings and discovered they contained a sandy mud mixture. When a new team of researchers re-scanned the mummy in 2017, they uncovered previously unknown details about the carapace, especially when they chemically reexamined the mud fragments.

After she died, the woman was mummified and wrapped in textiles. Then, her remains, including her left knee and lower leg, were damaged in ""unknown circumstances,"" possibly by grave robbers, which prompted someone to repair her mummy, likely within one to two generations of her first burial -- a feat that included ""rewrapping, packing and padding with textiles, and application of the mud carapace,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

Whoever repaired the mummy made a complicated earthy sandwich, placing a batter of mud, sand and straw between layers of linen wrappings. The bottom of the mud mixture had a base coat of a white calcite-based pigment, while its top was coated with ochre, a red mineral pigment, Sowada said. ""The mud was apparently applied in sheets while still damp and pliable,"" she said. ""The body was wrapped with linen wrappings, the carapace applied, and then further wrappings placed over it.""

Later, the mummy was damaged again, this time on the right side of the neck and head. Because this damage affects all of the layers, including the muddy carapace, it appears this damage was more recent and prompted the insertion of metal pins to stabilize the damaged areas at the time, the researchers said.

This ""mud mummy"" isn't the only ancient Egyptian mummy subject to post-mortem repair; the body of King Seti I was wrapped more than once, and so were the remains of King Amenhotep III (King Tut's grandfather), the researchers noted.

As for the woman's mud carapace, ""this is a genuinely new discovery in Egyptian mummification,"" Sowada said. ""This study assists in constructing a bigger -- and a more nuanced -- picture of how the ancient Egyptians treated and prepared their dead.""

After four years of the Trump administration, the United States received its worst score for perceived corruption in almost a decade. Fortunately, the end of the Trump era brought with it not only brought damage to America's reputation and institutions, but a promising new vehicle for their repair: the state-of-the-art anti-corruption provisions attached to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Fittingly, passing the NDAA required an override of then-President Trump's veto of the bill, but its enactment represented the first major act of Congress in the new year and a profound lift to the United States' damaged reputation for fighting corruption. Contained within the legislation's 1,480 pages are anti-corruption measures that advocates within and outside of government have championed for more than a decade; with its passage, the United States joins the community of nations working to combat the transnational scourges of shell companies and money laundering. Anti-corruption opportunities for 2021 and beyond abound.

Since the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which was the world's first piece of domestic legislation outlawing transnational bribery, the United States has played a leading role in global anti-corruption efforts. However, the ease with which domestic and foreign actors alike can create anonymous shell companies based in the U.S. -- a 2019 study found that forming a company requires the disclosure of less personal information than a library card in every state in the country -- has facilitated a range of malign activity. By not mandating the disclosure of companies' true owners, controllers, or financial beneficiaries -- known as beneficial owners -- the United States has become a hub for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, and other forms of corruption.

Fortunately, bipartisan supermajorities in Congress decided to do something about it. Title 64 of the NDAA -- known as the Corporate Transparency Act -- changes this state of affairs. The measure mandates (with some exceptions) that those seeking to form a company in the U.S. report their beneficial owners -- which the law defines as the global norm of a 25% or more ownership stake or ""substantial control over the entity"" -- to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). FinCEN will maintain an ""accurate, complete, and highly useful"" database of beneficial ownership information, which federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement authorities can access in the course of authorized investigations (as can financial institutions with customer consent).

The collection of this data and its access to law enforcement agencies will have profound ramifications for financial crimes investigations: Beneficial ownership opacity has previously hindered investigations into kleptocratic behavior, drug trafficking, political corruption, tax evasion, sanctions evasion, and more. It will also impede the ability of terrorist groups and other illicit actors to use shell companies to financially support their operations in the first place.

In addition to beneficial ownership transparency, the Corporate Transparency Act and other measures of the NDAA strengthen a range of other anti-money laundering provisions. The antiquities trade, long known for its use as a money laundering vehicle, will now be subjected to increased federal scrutiny under the terms of the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, from which it had previously been exempted. Meanwhile, other provisions improve information sharing among government agencies, create an anti-money laundering whistleblower reward and projection program, and require FinCEN to work to increase communication between law enforcement and bankers.

Lewis Friday, August 7, 2020

Each of these provisions, and especially those relating to beneficial ownership transparency, bring the United States ever-more in line with international best practices for anti-corruption efforts. Indeed, due to the privileged place that the U.S. holds in both finance matters and global leadership, these changes will have ripple effects beyond the country's borders. In the short term, U.S. action on beneficial ownership transparency may spur similar initiatives in Canada, while, as Clark Gascoigne of the FACT Coalition notes, State Department officials can now fend off charges of hypocrisy to push more effectively against money laundering in posts abroad. That gives the new administration a springboard to restoring U.S. moral authority on these issues globally at a time when that is badly needed. Longer term, as FinCEN and others implement the regulations in the bill and those start to take effect, global investigations run by the FBI (which has already been expanding its international corruption unit in recent years) and others will begin to bear fruit.

Of course, no bill is perfect, and the American anti-corruption agenda still has further to go. The beneficial ownership registry that FinCEN will create will be inaccessible to the public, unlike many others around the world that enable citizens to look up beneficial ownership information and so identify political conflicts of interest. The new administration should consider urgently working with Congress to fix this omission.

In addition, the threshold for requiring registration of beneficial owners is, at a 25% ownership stake, too high, according to many experts. This will likely cause some number of beneficial owners to remain in the shadows. While numerous other countries also use the 25% level, the U.S. should show more leadership. In addition, exemptions for trusts and partnerships leave some money laundering concerns outstanding.

Those issues notwithstanding, the NDAA's anti-corruption provisions are an enormous boon to integrity around the world, as well as creating an opening for a new American anti-corruption agenda. Beneficial ownership disclosure issues have long been furthered by organizations like the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), whose 2016 Panama Papers investigation opened many peoples' eyes to the breadth and depth of corporate ownership issues. Indeed, ICIJ's more recent FinCEN Files investigation, which delved into the ways in which global banks contribute to money laundering, provided the final impetus for the passage of the Corporate Transparency Act. In addition, the FACT Coalition -- an alliance of more than a hundred organizations working to promote fair taxation -- has spent nearly a decade assembling and activating a broad-based group of activists, researchers, national security professionals, law enforcement officials, banks, labor unions, and more to endorse and promote this legislation.

These organizations and others doing essential anti-corruption work are not going away, and they have reason to believe that their work will be bolstered by the new Biden administration, which has signaled that it will put anti-corruption at the heart of its agenda. Biden himself has pledged to combat corruption domestically by pushing for ethics and campaign finance reform and other policies, while promoting anti-corruption efforts abroad as one of the pillars of a new foreign policy. He has made an important down payment by adopting the best ever internal ethics plan for a new administration.

Biden's choice for national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, has promised to ""rally our allies to combat corruption and kleptocracy, and to hold systems of authoritarian capitalism accountable for greater transparency and participation in a rules-based system."" The administration contains many other champions in the battle against corruption.

In this effort, the broad-based alliance that successfully worked to enshrine these new anti-corruption measures into law via the NDAA will undoubtedly prove an important ally. And all those working to combat corruption -- including those of us in the Leveraging Transparency to Reduce Corruption initiative -- can take heart that the United States' role in creating a more transparent and accountable world seems poised to grow in 2021 and beyond. Hopefully, these NDAA provisions, together with other initiatives like the Biden ethics plan and such legislative anti-corruption efforts as H.R. 1, will create a rebound for the United States in Transparency International's annual rankings in 2022.",6409927510,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/01/28/a-momentous-victory-for-global-anti-corruption-efforts/,,,

The provision also requests the Treasury Department to conduct a study on the facilitation of money laundering and terrorist financing through the art market before the end of the year.

The responsibility would likely fall to Janet Yellen, acting through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Treasury's anti-money-laundering unit. Ms. Yellen has been nominated by President Biden for Treasury secretary and awaits approval from the Senate.

The provision comes as lawmakers and law enforcement agencies recognize sales of antiquities, such as cultural artifacts, as a risk area for illicit finance, said Gregory Lisa, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells U.S. LLP.

Antiquities sales have been used to finance terrorist organizations, law-enforcement officials and experts say.

""You're allowing cross-border transactions, you're allowing participants to transfer funds through the sale of either real or fake antiquities, without any controls around it,"" said Mr. Lisa, a former interim director of the Office of Compliance and Enforcement at FinCEN

The defense legislation contained other provisions aimed at curbing illicit finance, including new requirements for ownership disclosures.

The law asks the Treasury secretary, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, to define the scope of the impending anti-money-laundering rules on the antiquities market. That would include spelling out who should be subject to the requirements, whether the rule would focus on high-value trade in antiquities and whether purchasers of high-value antiquities would need to be identified.

The rules are also expected to clarify whether dealers and other participants in the antiquities trade need to be identified and whether there should be exemptions to the rule.

The Treasury Department didn't respond to a request for comment.

The new rules for the antiquities market could look like those for precious metals, stones and jewels, dealers and policy observers said.

Dealers in precious metals, stones or jewels are required to establish anti-money-laundering programs, according to a rule announced by FinCEN in 2005. The rules apply to dealers who have purchased and sold at least $50,000 worth of covered goods during the preceding year, according to FinCEN.

The anti-money-laundering rules for the antiquities market, as well as potentially the art market, might be stricter with a lower value threshold, said Polly Wilkins, an attorney representing high-net-worth individuals in international disputes and investigations at law firm Kobre & Kim LLP in London.",6400732039,https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-act-extends-anti-money-laundering-requirements-to-antiquities-market-11611311401,,,
