Also known as: Argenti di Morgantina, Hellenistic Silver & Morgantina Treasure
A silver hoard removed from the Sicilian site of Morgantina by looters around in 1979/80 which was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The Hellenistic settlement of Morgantina was founded around 1000 BC (Wilkerson 2001: 64), part of the ancient Kingdom of Syracuse (Stille 1999: 58). It is in central Sicily, close to the modern town of Aidone, however its exact location was lost for many years.
Morgantina declined rapidly after supporting, Carthage in the Second Punic War in 211 BC (Singleton 2006). The exact location of the city was then not rediscovered until 1955, when archaeologists from Princeton University found various artefacts and remains including a die marked ‘MGT’ for Morgantina; the first evidence to emerge of the settlement’s location (Carroll 2002).
For years the excavations have continued at Morgantina, led by American universities including Princeton University but later also the University of Virginia and Wesleyan University (Bell 2002: 201), but always with an awareness that tombaroli were also at work.
It is believed that in around 1979-1980, the Morgantina silver, sometimes referred to as the Morgantina Treasure (Steele 2000), was removed from the site by looters possibly using metal detectors (Fleishman 2000). The silver, consisting of 16 pieces including two small silver horns (Stille 1999: 63) and an emblem depicting the sea monster Scylla in sculptural relief (Singleton 2006), was then probably smuggled into Switzerland in around 1981 (Brodie 1998: 7). The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the silver in two lots over 1981 and 1982 from the antiquities dealer Robert Hecht, for a total sum of $2.7 million (Blouin Art Info 2010). The chain of events leading from the looting of the silver from Morgantina to its acquisition by the Met has been summarised by Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini (2006: 106), based on information received from the Carabinieri Art Squad:
“The route was as follows: Vincenzo Bossi and Filippo Baviera, tombaroli in Enna, sold the silver for 110 million lire ($27,000) to Orazio Di Simone, a Sicilian middleman based in Lugano in Switzerland, who sold it for $875,000 to Robert Hecht, who sold the silver to the Metropolitan Museum for $3 million[1].”
In 1984 Dietrich von Bothmer, the Met’s curator also connected with the acquisition of the Euphronios Krater , gave the silver preliminary publication in the museum’s Bulletin (Bell 2002: 202), with only vague details as to its possible provenance (Singleton 2006). The first of several proposals to return the silver was made four years later in 1988 when the provenience of the silver had been identified as Sicily (Bell 2002: 202). This was the year after Malcolm Bell, the university archaeologist in charge of ongoing excavations at Morgantina, had first seen the silver pieces on display in the Met and wrote to the museum explaining his suspicions that the artefacts had originated in Morgantina (Stille 1999: 63).
In the following years, Bell made several requests to view the silver, the first being in 1993, which was refused by the Met (Stille 1999: 64); such a refusal of a request from a serious scholar being considered “almost unheard of” (Hundley 2000). Evidence given by local tombaroli including Giuseppe Mascara (Stille 1999: 64), who was arrested in 1996 and disclosed information about the looting of the Morgantina silver in an attempt to shorten his sentence (Singleton 2006), included the alleged find spot of the silver (Eakin and Povoledo 2006). This led to a further representation to the Met by the Italian government using the testimony gathered from the tombaroli. However, the Met’s executive vice president, Ashton Hawkins, “informed the Italians that the museum could not rely on the word of a convicted looter trying to reduce his sentence” (Stille 1999: 64). Meanwhile, the Italian government had in the same year asked Bell to carry out investigations to attempt to pinpoint the site of the looting (Wilkerson 2001), and in 1997 and 1998 excavations were carried out by Bell and the US expedition to Morgantina at “the Greek house where the treasure was originally found” (Bell 2002: 203). The team discovered in the floor of the house two holes that corresponded with the size of the hoard as purchased by the Met, including in one of the holes a 1978 Italian coin that helped support the suggested date of the looting (Wilkerson 2001). That the Met purchased the silver in two lots seemed to support the suggestion that the treasure was found on two different occasions, resulting in the two separate holes that were discovered by the excavation (Singleton 2006). Also discovered was a bronze coin that was minted between 214 and 212 BC, which corresponded to the date when Morgantina was known to have been attacked (211 BC) and would support the notion that the silver may have been concealed around this time so as to avoid its theft or destruction during the conflict (Bell 2002: 203).
In 1999, Bell was finally permitted to view the Morgantina silver at the Met, and was convinced of the true provenance of the hoard, to the extent of translating the Greek inscription found on two of the vessels as ‘of Eupolemos’, a name already associated with Morgantina from other data found at the site (Singleton 2006). This differed from the Met’s own translation by von Bothmer of the inscription as ‘from the war’; a term almost identical to the possessive of Eupolemos in the Ancient Greek (Watson and Todeschini 2006: 106).
It took several more years for the Italian government and the Met to reach an agreement with regard to the final destination of the Morgantina silver, with Philippe de Montebello, then the director of the Met suggesting in a letter in 2003 to Giuliano Urbani, then the Italian Culture Minister, “that the museum might be willing to cede title to the 15 pieces of silver if it were allowed to keep the set for 25 more years” (Eakin and Povoledo 2006). It was not until 2006 that an agreement was finally reached, which covered other repatriation claims as well as the Morgantina silver, including the Euphronios Krater, a Laconian kylix and three examples of red-figured pottery (Metropolitan Museum 2006). The agreement, signed on the 21 February 2006, allowed for the Morgantina silver to remain in New York on loan and on display until January 2010 (Povoledo 2006), but also for the Met to be provided with loans of ‘comparably great works of ancient art’ (Metropolitan Museum 2006) from Italy for its displays. Upon returning to Italy, the Morgantina silver went on display in Rome (CBSNews 2010), then Palermo (Gallo 2010), and finally the museum in Aidone. Aidone is expected to benefit economically from the recent repatriation not only of the Morgantina silver, but also of two acrolithic sculptures formerly in the possession of collector Maurice Tempelsman, and the ‘Getty Aphrodite’; all three of which sculptures are believed also to have been looted from Morgantina (Blouin Art Info 2010).

The Aidonia Treasure is a collection of Mycenaean gold and jewelry returned to Greece in 1996 and thought to have been robbed from a cemetery at Aidonia in the late 1970s.
Aidonia is a village ten kilometres northwest of Nemea in the northeastern Peloponnesian district of Corinthia in Greece. In November 1976, a Mycenaean (fifteenth-century BC) cemetery was discovered not far from the village, and the tombs were dug out illegally by local archaiokapiloi (a term used for looters in Greece) (Miller 1997: 40; Waxman 2007: 347). There were reports of a gun battle between rival gangs of archaiokapiloi, and evidence that local government officials had sanctioned and even participated in the plunder (Miller 1997: 43; Waxman 2008: 347). Looted objects were rumoured to have been smuggled out of Greece hidden in watermelons (Miller 1997: 41).
In November 1977, the Greek Archaeological Service assigned a guard to the site, and in Spring 1978 it commenced official excavations. Twenty chamber tombs were discovered, but only two had survived untouched. The remaining eighteen tombs had been largely emptied of their contents, though in one (Tomb 7), the looters had overlooked a pit dug into the floor of the tomb. After excavation, it was found to contain an assemblage of gold jewelry (Krystalli-Votsi 1996). (Mycenaean chamber tombs typically contain several interments and may be richly furnished with pottery, metalwork and jewelry).
Nothing much was heard outside Greece about the plundered Aidonia cemetery until April 1993, when New York’s Michael Ward Gallery offered on display for sale a collection comprising approximately fifty items of Mycenean gold jewelry and sealstones. A catalogue accompanying the display entitled Gold of the Mycenaeans, with an introduction and object descriptions by archaeologist John Betts, could only offer ‘a European collector’ for provenance. Potential customers were reassured by the catalogue, however, that gold analyses conducted by Jack Ogden of the Cambridge Centre for Precious Metal Research had guaranteed the authenticity of the material, and that in reply to a written enquiry the Greek Ministry of Culture had confirmed that the material was not stolen (Elia 1995: 121). The asking price for the assemblage was US$1.5 million (Elia 1995: 120).
On 4 April 1993, the display was trailed in the New York Times, where the objects were described as ‘rare gold baubles: small, ancient and radiant’ (Reif 1993a). Two days later, on 6 April, archaeologist Ricardo Elia alerted the Consul General of Greece in New York to the material on display (Elia 1995: 126, note 17; Honan 1993). On 27 April 1993, archaeologist James Wright, who had worked at Nemea, informed the Greek Archaeological Service of his suspicion that the material might have been looted from Aidonia (Elia 1995: 126, note 17). After obtaining a copy of the catalogue, the Greek Ministry of Culture convened a committee of experts to investigate the possible origin of the material. The committee concluded that because of close stylistic and technical affinities between objects excavated legitimately at Aidonia and those offered for sale in New York, the New York material must have been looted from Aidonia. The Ministry of Culture also recognized that it had received a letter in 1992 from an Athenian lawyer asking for information about the objects, though not mentioning the name of Michael Ward. The Ministry had responded that while there was no evidence to show that the material had been illegally excavated or stolen from a museum, if any such evidence should become available then Greece reserved the right to ask for the material’s return (Elia 1995: 121).
On 14 May 1993, attorneys acting on behalf of Greece notified Ward that the material was the property of Greece and asked for its return (Elia 1991: 122). On 25 May they obtained an injunction from the US District Court, Southern District of New York, preventing the sale or transport out the state of the material, and sued for its return (Elia 1995: 122; Ehl 1998: 675). On 30 December 1993, an out-of-court settlement was announced whereby Ward undertook to donate the material to the US-based Society for the Preservation of the Greek Heritage (SPGH). By donating the material to the charitable SPGH instead of directly to Greece, Ward was able to claim a tax deduction for the purchase price of the material, said to be $150,000 (Walsh 1996). Because Ward was a dealer, he was limited to claiming the cost to himself of acquiring the material. If he had been a collector, he would have been able to claim its fair market value, thought by Ward to be $1.5 million (Ehl 1998: 676-7). The SPGH returned the material to Greece in 1996 (Howland 1996; Walsh 1996).
The settlement between Greece and Ward was welcomed by some commentators, but there have also been expressions of regret that the case never proceeded to court. On the positive side, the settlement secured the return of what was most likely illicit material to Greece. Ward avoided the large financial loss that he would have incurred if the court had decided against his ownership. Both sides minimized their legal fees. By settling out-of-court, however, any information possessed by Ward about the material’s provenance remained a private matter. It is thought unlikely that the material offered by Ward and recovered by Greece represents the totality of the material looted from Aidonia. There was no pottery, for example. Without more information about provenance, there is little hope of locating and recovering the remainder (Elia 1995:123).
In the absence of reliable provenance, it has also been argued that the source of the recovered material is far from definite. The Aidonia provenience was established on the basis of stylistic and technical similarities, but while these similarities might suggest an area of common manufacture, they do not necessarily indicate a place of joint deposition. The objects acquired by Ward might possibly have been found elsewhere. If the case had gone to court, uncertainties surrounding the method used to establish source would probably have been exploited, and it is possible that they would have fatally undermined Greece’s case (Fitzpatrick 1996: 57). These lingering doubts about source also make it potentially misleading to lump together the material obtained through legitimate excavation with that recovered from Ward as a singular ‘treasure’ (Cherry 1999: 109). Again, if the provenance of the material had been resolved in a court of law, using evidence apart from that of the objects themselves, the status of the ‘treasure’ would have been made more secure, to the benefit of archaeological scholarship.
Ward later claimed that Greece had concocted a provenance and that US archaeologists had embarrassed Greece into taking action (Marks 2005: 194). After the looting had ended, the residents of Aidonia fell to feuding amongst themselves, and the village was largely abandoned (Waxman 2008: 348). New tombs are believed to have been robbed there in 2002 and 2004 (Brodie and Apostolidis 2007: 49). The Greek journalist Nikos Zirganos has compared what happened at Aidonia unfavourably to nearby Nemea, where finds from a long-term programme of archaeological excavation and research are curated in a purpose-built museum for the benefit of the general public (Waxman 2007: 348).
